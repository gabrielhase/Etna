I enjoyed my trip to Etna, but I wasn&#39;t blown away by it. It consists of lots of craters in black gravel which you can walk around. Higher up (which you have to pay quite a bit to reach) you can see smoking craters and warm ground.
The area is full of tourist shops and diners.

Next we headed to Mt Etna where the tourist office in Lingualossa was very friendly. We headed up the snow-covered mountain to 1400 meters until where the road was destroyed by a massive lava flow. It was fun to climb the flow &amp;#8211; you need good shoes and pants, some of the rocks were still warm from six months earlier.
