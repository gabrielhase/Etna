Etna is a magnificent monument of nature, and is in itself its own testament that no word picture can hope to expand. It looms over the eastern Sicilian landscape and in its current firy incarnation reveals why primitive man worshipped such deities. They have given living abundance to the soil surrounding. Approach with due awe and reverence, for as Etna has in history and recent past she will again speak with the voice of a god raining down death and destruction, an oracle concerning the impermanence of man made monuments. Most recent ruins abound. One is privileged to walk on her flanks. Do so while it remains possible.

We didn't go for any of the tours, we simply drove as far up as we could with our rental car, and it was really worth it, the views were fantastic. We drove from Catania towards the West, and circumnavigated the Etna, stopping along the way in little villages, and it's a pleasant way to get some great view of the Etna and of the coast around.

Although impressive, between the cold and the wind we almost froze in March! Try to visit on a day when the weather gods are smiling so that you can do some hiking around: the landscape is unique and unforgettable. The day after we were there, the belching of boulders from Miss Etna reached one of the surrounding villages and broke windshields.

The view from the top is amazing on a clear day. The drive there was fairly easy and the road conditions were pretty good. An SUV would make it up there just fine. We parked in the Rifugio Sapienza area and paid 2.50 euros for a half day parking pass. Didn't bother with the tourist traps, gift shops or restaurants. We packed our own lunch and wandered freely around the trails. Stay on the beaten path if you're bad with directions. It would have been awesome to see Etna in action... perhaps another day.

Davide, our personal guide arranged by our B&amp;B, took us up 2,000ft near the top. He showed us the old lava flows, and houses that had had the lava stop close by. We had a taste of honey in a shop that had lava walls. Interesting that locals stripped their houses when the lava flowed down to their houses and then rebuilt right above their original houses. Saw the birch groves and the snow covered by the black ash. Etna was smoking and they were expecting an eruption that week, but we missed it. Very exciting trip around Etna, and stopped at some local produce stores. Dont miss it if nearby.

If you are in Western Sicily early in the year, and fancy skiing on Europe's most active volcano, it's definitely worth considering a day on the slopes of Mount Etna, you ski over lava, past small craters, look up to see the steam rising from the peak, and down to distant citrus groves and the blue waters of the Med.<br /><br />The ski area we visited was small, so not worth an extended trip, but for a couple of days of low key family skiing it was worth it for the experience.<br /><br />Here are a few tips. First of all check the weather - if winds are high, lifts will be intermittent if working at all (etnasci.com is good for snow, lifts and weather, all info is in Italian). Italian law requires you to have snowchains with you above a certain altitude in the winter months, but these are for sale on the lower slopes of Etna. Also be aware that your diesel car may not like the lower temperatures at the top - we had trouble starting ours.<br /><br />We skied from Etna Nord, where there is one chair lift (blue slope), and three drags (red slope). All the slopes are relatively easy skiing compared to Alpine slopes, and are quite short, the blue in particular is very gentle. There is easy, cheap (€3/day) parking near the chair lift, but if it's a weekend and there is sun and snow, get there before 9am to get a spot, otherwise parking is possible on the roads. There are a collection of small huts on the lava field, which somehow manage to hire out skis, boots etc (at about €40/day for an adult), and sell great coffee and hot chocolate, and basic snacks (panini, chips etc). Queues on a sunny Sat/Sun took a long time, and given the short slopes and slow lifts, unless you are a complete beginner you'll do a lot more waiting than skiing. There is a very good restaurant at the bottom of the long drag, but to get back to the main lift, you'll have to make it up a long, steep, windy drag (if you fall off near the top, the only option is to take off skis and scramble down a rocky slope), which may be an issue if you have younger kids.<br /><br />There is also a ski school.

Since we choose to visit Sicily in January, we expected snow on Etna and got it. Its a great shame that virtually everywhere you go in Sicily is full of litter and the lower slopes of Mount Etna are no exception. We chose a clear fine day for our drive on the Via Etna and arrived at the Rifugio Sapienza (1910m), with the temperature at zero and about 60cm of snow, we left 20 deg at sea level. The road is good and snow ploughed and the views over Sicily were magnificent. Sadly at this time of year you cannot get to the top, as the cable car was not operating, but it was still worth the visit. You need to be aware that during the winter months you are required to carry snow chains if you are driving on the Via Etna (or anywhere else on the mountain at high level.)

When you get to the parking lot at the top of the mountain, you go into the building with the cable car. Buy a ticket- it's pricy, like 70 euro per person- and get in line for the cable car. Then you arrive and are loaded onto a truck/van thingy. (Now is the time if you need a restroom. There is a small cafe and gift shop.) Next, they take you up to the top and a guide will walk you around and recite info in Italian, English, French and anything else he knows. The craters are pretty neat. The hiking is easy, though some sections are steep, but it's very manageable for people of all ages. There is a small shack to buy post cards, magnets and posters. After about an hour they will take you back down. Bring a coat and gloves even in the summer, (well, maybe not August!), it's chilly up there.

Mt Etna was worth the visit so you can say you have been on a live, active volcano. We were with an Insight Tour so we drove there on our coach. Had snowed lightly the day before but our day was fine but quite cool. Obviously if you want to walk up onto one of the craters you will need to be sure footed and have good footwear,but it was quite an easy walk. Lovely views. Spoilt only by the rubbish littered everywhere. There was a school group there and they were all just throwing their rubbish over the barriers into the crater. Very disappointing to see no one looking after that. Food was great in the cafe we chose and a great afternoon. Nice to go back to our hotel and see her smoking away.

If you are in eastern Sicily you'd be an idiot to miss mount Etna, unless perhaps you are from Iceland where volcanoes are everywhere. Take a day and go to the top of the mountain. It is indeed a live volcano. The lift that gets you near the summit is on the south side. Don't get lost up there, though. It's true about the weather being treacherous.

There are two way to climb Mount Etna from the Hotel/Rifugio Sapienza by foot or by cable car. I will encourage you to take the cable car since the climb by foot which roughly takes 4 hours is a monotonous walk in black ashes. If you decide to do it, take plenty of water. It is tiring to walk in sand like black ashes.<br /> <br />The view from Sicily's highest peak is outstanding, reaching from the tip of Italy to northern Africa. The volcano remains active and has created a landscape of lava covered by snow which is in turn covered with volcanic ashes. This &quot;black&quot; snow surround you as if you were in the middle of the Sahara! The walk to Etna is conducted in small groups led by a guide. After beginning the ascent with the cable car, you take a large four-wheel drive jeep, and finally you continue on foot. The latter part is not challenging and requires only good walking shoes and a wind breaker. A crater created by a recent eruption is reached after a 5 mn walk, from there the guide takes you from craters to craters and bring you back to the mountain hut where the jeeps are waiting for you. The walking tour takes about one hour. <br /><br />If you are hungry, the food at the Rifugio Sapienza is poor and overpriced. Bring your own sandwich.

A very nice spot to visit to appreciate the wonders of mother nature. This volcano is active but not enough so as of the date of this review to avoid going to see it. The various craters are fairly well defined and one can circumnavigate one or another to get a better idea of the calderas. But there are so many diverse calderas that you might be better off just glimpsing at as many as you can while you are there - they are not all the same.

We got this gentle and elegant shape during our vacation in the eastern Sicily. This far quietness completely changes once we've been on the top of him. A rough and cold personality much more interesting and attractive than it could seem to be... Even if mount Etna is an active volcano where it is easy to get noises from spots of bubbling lava and stare at little smoke columns coming out from craters around it is covered by snow in Winter season. Locals use to go skiing or snowboarding on the Etna for breathtaking runnings on paths looking at the sea downhill. A rough personality as that of Mount Etna would then show his romantic side through lovely surroundings around. Mount Etna can be still very funny and we were surrounded by a dense fog quite the most of our way up so we couldn't get that much..

The Etna area is simply gigantic. Soo much to see - but we only managed to get around the south side of this incredible massif - so we need to get back at some point to see more.<br /><br />The enormous masses of stiffened lava is just amazing around the area - buried houses, black or red stone/sand and colorful vegetation is simply beautiful contrasts in autumn.<br /><br />We went up to the top (2900 m) with bus and elevator - and walked down again in the lava sand one day. But don't forget to dress proper for ice cold winds if you go up there in November.<br /><br />We also visited the red beautiful Silvestri-craters (an 10 seconds earthquake occured when we where going up the highest crater), the lavatube (Tre Livelli) where you will need climbing gear and guide.<br /><br />We hired MTB's and biked around and down to Nicolosi again - in very thick fog.

We were fortunate the day we went to Mt. Etna the fog had not set in yet and we were able to see the surrounding area on the way up. One does not realize the desolation that occurs from a volcano and the amount of time it takes for any vegetation to regrow. Once at the top there are several smaller craters that can be easily walked to. It is a real hike up to the main crater and since I was using a cane to walk I could not go there. The black lava rock is interesting ground cover. There are several places to buy food but as far as I am concerned the little shop at the far right hand side of the road as you get to the top is the place to go. There was a man cooking sausages on a grill. They were absolutely delicious. One must also try one of the cannelloni, which was the best I have eaten.

If you're lucky enough to go up Etna (as constant eruptions can cause disruptions), it's quite the experience. In the winter if there is enough snow you can ski or snowboard &amp; in the warmer months you can either trek up the mountain or take a truck up &amp; trek the last bit to the main crater.

If driving rent a GPS. You're life will be much easier. - DRESS WARM; IT'S VERY COLD ON TOP OF THE VOLCANO and we arrived after the season's first snow of about 2 inches covering all of the lava rock. It was beautiful.<br /><br />Getting to Mt Etna is a lovely meandering drive down small rwo lane roads that have little traffic and lovely sightseeing. Very woodsy. We drove in mid-November and as you climb higher in elevation we were treated to hills completely covererd with trees in full fall foliage color. Just beautiful.<br /><br />Arrived at the staging area. There are a few souvenir stores and places to get a light bite to eat. You climb the steps up to the ticket area which is also where the funicular (tram) leaves from. Splurge and buy the full ticket up to the top of the volcano which includes a walking tour. It is 60.5 Euros and well worth it. (About $80 US) Don't bother going up just for the tram ride.<br /><br />After purchasing your ticket you board one of the slow moving enclosed funicular cars on your own for the trip up the lower part of the volcano. Each car holds 6 people (3 seats facing each other. You would think with the money they are making off tourists they could afford to replace the plexiglass which has scratches and people's names and initials carved into the glass. You can still see but it's really annoying to see what idiotic people have done.<br /><br />As you climb higher and higher you can see different views all over the island as well as the lava left from previous eruptions. Everything is black until you get near the top which then became snow covered.<br /><br />After arrival at the top you will enter a building where you can have something to eat and explore the second floor which has many large photos of previous eruptions in all their glory. There is a video on in the dining area to watch as well. There are some Mt. Etna logo sweatshirts and jackets that aren't bad. If you don't think you are dressed warmly enough you can actually rent a jacket, boots, etc. for about 2E each. I wore a regular top, a sweater and a fleecy jacket which was sufficient although my ears got cold on the walk.<br /><br />There will be a time stamp on your ticket. The snow vehicle that holds about 28 people will fill up with people and off you go. It was surreal. As we climbed on the black lava road (very smooth) up the mountain all we could see was snow covered lava as we went higher and higher. <br /><br />When we arrived at the top (8,000+ fett) we were met by a guide who spoke good English and we began our walking tour. We stopped several times to see the crater at different places with steam clouds still coming out from the previous eruption. All in all the tour is about 45 minutes and is up and down so can be challenging especially because you are 8,000 feet above sea level. I'm very fit and I was out of breath. Walking through the couple inches of snow was also a challenge but it wasn't slippery and we all made it. Frankly I don't know how some of these old people made it. It's not a walk in the park. Back on the bus there was some obvious catching of breath by the out of shapes.<br /><br />It was a surreal experience. It was still cloudy with bits of sun trying to break through, the volcano itself covered in snow and the surrounding was like walking in a cloud. Everything white and very memorable. The only black we could see at the top was the road we came up on.<br /><br />Afterwards we re-boarded the sno-bus and back down to the bottom where the sun was coming out and on to the next adventure. It was a great experience.

It was truly magical to hike on the volcano with snow all around, and steam raising up for the mountain top opening. A must do!<br /><br />Recommendations...<br />If you are active, hike up the summit instead of paying for the jeep ride to the top. The views are remarkable, the experience is truly authentic and there are incredible photo opportunities along the way. The restaurant at the bottom of the hill has basic food, but was warm and cozy for a quick drink/bit after the hike.

I was lucky to have selected a day that had such clear skies and a guide (Guilia from Etna Tribe company) that made every attempt to make us comfortable and the trip to be interesting. The view of the volcano was breathtaking and the view from every angle was fantastic! We visited a cave, found a fox, stopped at a organic honey farm and did many other interesting things on the way to the mountain and back. The car was extremely comfortable and roomy. We had a lot of fun! Seeing an active volcano that close was a real life experience! The only downside (if there was any) was the very expensive cable car ride (about 30 Euro) for a few minutes on a cable car. I have been to many parts of the world and gone on many cable cars that took through breathtaking views, but never paid that much!! Other than that, the trip was fully worth. I will recommend to anyone visiting Catania to book through Etna Tribe Travel and be lucky to get Guilia as your guide!!

On a recent cruise we booked Sicily Life to take a group of 6 to visit Taormina and Castelmola. Antonio picked us up promptly from Catania and drove us to Taormina. Unfortunately he could not control the weather and the heavens opened!! Etna remained hidden from us the entire day! Antonio made the best of a bad situation and showed us as much as possible from the vehicle. He then led us to a very quirky restaurant/bar in Castelmola for reviving coffee where we were made very welcome by his friends. We decided to shorten our walking time in Taormina due to the weather and again he was very accomodating and found a few more sights to show us from the vehicle. On our return to Catania to rejoin our cruise ship, he drove around showing us as much as possible without venturing out into the very heavy downpour. We hope to return to this lovely area one day in batter weather and will definitely ask for Antonio again.

Although Mt. Etna was in cloud for most of our trip, the drive to the top was worth it to see the vast fields of lava - quite a contrast to the surrounding terrain. Because of the cloud we didn't take the gondola higher up, but I bet it would be fantastic on a clear day.

We felt the volcano in Hawaii was very interesting but it was like dwarfed by the lava, house in the lava, views for miles if the weather is good and the spectacular views as you continued to wind up the side of the mountain. At the top are several shops with different kinds of trinkets to higher end items. A real heaven for the shopper especially those who love to taste all kinds of wine tasting.

Have visited different volcanoes in the world but this one has its own different character. For one thing everything is black and the lava and basalt rocks seem to be finer. The multiple craters are smaller and of different ages (the most recent is only a few weeks old - not withstanding that this is an active volcano).<br />Great scenic views of the volcano itself and the surrounding countryside.<br />On the way up pay attention to the nearby towns which had been affected and has had lava flow into or around them.<br /><br />Since this is way above sea level make sure to have a warm jacket and closed walking shoes. <br /><br />Old people with cane were enjoying the climb which was not too steep.

Some reviews on this site imply that ascending Etna from the south is complicated. It isn't, if you're reasonably fit and prepared to walk. It also costs nothing apart from a small fee to park the car. From Refugio Sapienza, you can walk up beneath the cable car route to the cable car top station. The footpath is well-marked though a bit slippy on the gravel in places, but there is also another relatively smooth, longer, zig-zag vehicle track. It took us around 1hr 20min to ascend this section to the cable car station. Alternatively you can pay 28 euros to cover the same in 10 minutes. There is a cafe and shop here. The next stage is to walk to the highest permissible place nearest the summit - pretty much the same location as where the 4WD buses take you to. Walking there is easy, on either clear tracks or a wide smooth zig-zag road, and takes around 1.5 hours. So in total, around 3 hours to the end point, at 2,920m and around 1km from the top of the mountain. You are legally not allowed to go further and enter the prohibited danger zone. You can see the edge of the south-east crater (from below), which smokes constantly and there is a phenomenal view all round. You can even buy drinks, snacks and souvenirs too (the buses turn round here)! If you don't want to walk this second stage, the 4WD buses depart frequently from the cable car top station. I believe the combined price for cable car and bus is around 60 euros per person, return. So if you walk, you save 60 euros, but it takes 3 hrs up and then around 1-1.5hrs down. Allow 6 hours for the round trip including time at the top. The view of the smoking summit and sulphur deposits is fantastic, the black volcanic landscape is superb. Take care if the weather is cold, cloudy, windy or wet though, as the experience could become much more difficult! In clear weather it is brilliant, and very straightforward. Go for it!

We (me and my 17 &amp; 19 year old sons) took the long trip with Gruppo Guide Alpine Etna Sud. It starts with the cable car, then with terrain buses, and then a long walk. We came within a mile from the most recently active craters. But they tower above you, you cannot look down into them.<br /><br />Apparently, this is dangerous, and there were signs that forbade you moving closer. It was still slightly disappointing not to see floating lava :)<br /><br />We still crossed a reasonably fresh lava flow (from April 2012) where smoke seeped out between the stones and you could feel the heat underneath.<br /><br />On the way down, we ran through dunes of brimstone dust, which was great fun. But the dust pervades everything, so remember not to wear anything that doesn't wash.<br /><br />It is beautiful on Mount Etna. We went during the heatwave in early August 2012, and it was a relief to be in 15-20 degrees. The guide was very informative, helpful and spirited. <br /><br />There is no fee to enter Mount Etna, but in practice, you would use either the cable car or the terrain buses or both. You would also probably go with a guided group, as we did.

The tallest active volcano in Europe! 25 miles across! the lava fields are enormous. Take warm clothing and possibly gloves - trainers or hiking boots important. Be careful if you have any respiratory problems as the oxygen level is lower. An incredible view even from the base of the cable cars. You can go into the remains of a recent volcano here last eruption 1986. Good shops and restaurants and a chance to go to the summit, but costs a lot - about €50.

Dont bother to pack special shoes and socks for this, the guides will probably just think your gear is not good enough and give you rentals. Rentals are included in the price of the tour. Make sure your shoes fit bc you get these tiny rocks in your shoes and they cut into your feet. Bring a fleece but if its a sunny day, you shouldnt need much else. Be ware, the guide kinda makes you run (i'm not kidding, like run down a steep mountain in ankle high volcanic ash/rocks) down the mountain.YOU NEED SOMETHING TO COVER YOUR NOSE/MOUTH. You should also wear long pants that go over your shoes.<br /><br />Buy food at the restaurant at the base of the mountain. You will stop for a lunch break at the top.

Just back from a long day at Etna Sud...<br />We arrived in Southern Sicily Yesterday (20 Oct 2012) with no plans on what to do on Etna, but just to go as high as possible. We drove to Etna Sud (Refugio Sapienza) and arrived at 10 am. walked up to the &quot;Excursion Area&quot; close to the cable car, to find out what was possible for a family of four - two kids of 9 and 7. We spoke to Etnaguides.com in their wodden house, and were told that there was a 4 hour trek - leaving at 10:30 - 65Euro/person. At first they a bit reluctant to have us on the tour, given the age of of our kids. But after telling them, that the kids had climbed Stromboli two days earlier - we were allowed to join the trip. <br />The trek was long, exhausting, informative and a great experience. Cable car up, 4WD Mini bus to 2800m, and then started the trekking. We were of the impression that the trip was a total of 4 hours, but it was the trekking part. Which resulted in being slightly too much for our 7 years old daugther, so after three hours, she ended taken the cable car down with her mom. Our 9 years old son nejoyned the entire trek.<br />The guide (•Gianbattista ) was very informative about the geology and the history of the volcano. The trek was putting it to the limit for a familiy with two kids below 10y. But a great experience - and a proud son the rest of the day.<br /><br />Why not Excellent: <br />No visa card payment for trek<br />A bit more info of the length of the trek would have been fine

Mount Etna was one of those places on my bucket list &amp; it didn't disappoint. The cable car on the way up allowed for a great view of what looked like the moon surface but black. When we got on the ground black volcanic rocks were every where - what a great place for a film set. What also blew me away (in June) was that there was pockets of snow still on top of the black rocks, quite a contrast. The fact that Etna was smoldering on our day just topped it off. I cant believe that this is also a winter ski field, where during time of eruption all huts, cable car towers are all destroyed.

In travelling around the world I find a couple of things make for a memorable trip; one is food with new friends; and the other is seeing something like you have never seen before. <br /><br />Most of us have never seen anything like Etna before. <br /><br />It's the scale of the thing and the sheer destructive power of nature unleashed that gets you. Once that lava begins flowing there is no power on earth that can stop it. In the civilised world, we sometimes forget that nature uncontrolled is a fearsome sight.<br /><br />It's a must-see must-do thing. Though if you want to see red-hot lava, you may be better going to Stromboli which is more active than Etna. <br /><br />We thought long and hard about whether to pay around euro 60 each for a jeep tour of the lower slopes, or pay around euro 150 each to get to the top. <br /><br />In the end, we settled for the cheaper option, but we were not disappointed. Euro 150 each seemed like a lot, for a potentially limited experience. Besides which we are not as fit as we once were.<br /><br />We took TripAdvisor's advice and selected the top-rated tour. These things change, but we were thrilled with our tour providers. The adice they gave during the trip was that it is OK to get to the top, but you do not see much more than on the lower slopes. I don;t know if that advice is good or not. But there it is.<br /><br />Either way, we had spent a tranquil and interesting morning in a 4x4 talking, laughing and chatting, when we arrived at the bottom of the cable car we felt we had hit the hordes. <br /><br />Of course that's not necessarily a bad thing, but the contrast was pretty astonishing.<br /><br />You can watch any number of TV documentaries and not appreciate the scale of it all. Nor the different textures. I had expected to see large slabs of pillow lava - rocks, basically, but instead the top of the lava flows was a crumbled mass of small and mid-sized stones, each with edges as sharp as a razor. <br /><br />You also do not realise the depth of the lava - maybe 20m deep or more. Or the temperature. Lava which erupted 10 years ago is still hot. In a quarry down the mountain the rocks they dig out of the ground are almost 100°C because in 10 years they have not yet cooled properly.<br /><br />We visited on a beautiful Autumn day and up at 2000m it was stil warm enough to wear tee-shirts, though a jacket or pullover helped in the wind. A stout pair of shoes, whoever is a must, because those rocks are shorp.<br /><br />Enjoy!

We were picked up from the hotel and taken to the cable car from where we did a really interesting treck round the craters of the 2002 eruption. We did not go to the top of the mountain. Our guides were two young students who were really knowledgeable and were very good at imparting that knowledge to us. They kept their talks short and frequent so we had plenty of breaks and everybody could keep up with the pace. We were delivered back to the hotel after six hours away.

We visited Mount Etna from Catania and decided to go DIY rather than an escorted tour so that we could spend more time there without rushing up and down. There is only one bus a day there and back from Catania leaving from the bus station by the railway station at 8.15am and returning from Mt Etna at about 4.30pm (cost about £8.00 I think). Transport is by air condition comfortable coach and takes about an hour and a half. The bus drops off at the car park at Refugio Sapienza where there is a number of bars, touristy shops, etc. I think there is also a crater to investigate at this level if you don't want to go any further. We then took the cable car (about 28 euro each) up to the next station. There is also a shop, restaurant, toilets, etc. here and this is where you can hire jackets,etc. We decided to hike to the top from here, alternatively there is a 4 x 4 bus to drive you up (about another 30 euro each). Make sure you wear sturdy boots/trainers as some of the path is very, very loose and also take a jacket ready for the fall in temperature. We are in our fifties and certainly didn't rush to the top - with plenty of photo stops it probably took us about one and a half hours (obviously less time to go back down!).

You can see Mount Etna from a distance. That is the best way to see it. In most countries national parks are taken care of. Not here. As we drove to the national park there was trash all over. Tires on the volcanic fields. Loads of bottles and trash dumped at the side of the road and on the hillside. Next to the billboards was all the used paper from the previous advertisements. At the base where you take the gondola ride the volcanic fields were full of debris. I did not even want to take a picture. If they take care of the national park this way I can't even imagine what the rest of the island looks like. Our tour guide told us this was due to the divisions of government. Cities, regions and municipalities all arguing on who's job it was to keep the park clean. This is a disgrace for Sicily. Shame on you!!!

We arrived at Mt Etna on our own by car and learned too late that the mid morning is a bad time to arrive. All of the tour buses arrive @ 10-10;30 so there is a huge bottle neck to get up on to the gondola and it is not organized so people are pushing to get ahead. On our way down, after taking the truck to the top about 2 hours later, there was not a sole waiting to get on to the gondola.<br /><br />The experience is well worth the money which is @ 60 euro per person to get to the top ( plus an extra 4 euro for parking) but if you are on your own and can arrive closer to noon, you will have a much more enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Another note, you pay as part of the fee, a 9 euro obligatory charge for a guide at the top. We never saw one so you may want to enquire how to access the tour that you are paying for.

If you are in Sicily a trip to Mt Etna is a must! We toured the active volcano through a group called Sicily Life who are able to arrange your transportation and provvide a guide. Corrado was the guide for our trip from Sicily Life and he was so informative and knowledgeable about the three active periods of the eruptions and explained the topography on how you track the time lines and the vegetation and it was not boring! It had a certain amount of intrigue. I would highly recommend Sicily Life for this tour. We used this company for many of our other excursions...all we can say is that Sicily Life makes your travel so easy and comfortable. We will definitely use them agai should whe. We return!!!

An experience not to be missed. The scenery is fascinating and thought provoking - you can see the tops of houses just showing above the lava on the way up the mountain - and yet it is beautiful. We only went to the last refuge by coach but you can go higher up by cable car. Remember to take something warm to wear, though, because after the temperatures lower down it feel positively chilly!

Much better than we thought - the scenery is amazing as it changes from gently wooded slopes and much greenery to acres of black lava streams - we only went to the last refuge by car as we were not equipped to go higher but the views were stunning - the route up from the south is much more barren and the route down the other side is prettier and better views of the three craters at the summit but still studded with lava flows and mounds where steam has escaped and shows how close to towns the lava flow has come. The little exhibition at the refuge with photos and a film is worth going to as it explains about the eruptions - you will probably end up having to pay some local a few euros to &quot;explain&quot; the photos in very broken English and to give you a cake and cheese (although the exhbition is free) and then pay another local to go to the loo but that is part of the Siciian experience - there was even someone on the way back at the ticket machine on the autoroute taking the tickets out and giving them to you in exchange for payment

We went up to Rifugio Sapienza (RS) in the bus which starts in Catania. We boarded the bus in Nicolosi at about 0915 hrs and within next half hour we reached RS. There a host of souvenir shops at the place where the bus drops you. You can hire some private guide as a group or you can walk straight up to funivia dell'etna and get tickets for EUR 60 each. We got discounted tickets for EUR 50 each as our B&amp;B gave us a voucher. The views from top were breathtaking though it was a cloudy day. Its a great experience standing on an active volcano.<br /><br />Some points: <br />A jacket is a must up on the mountain. You can bring your own or hire one for EUR 2 at the juncture between the cable car ride and the 4x4 ride. <br /><br />If you have a baby stroller, try not to take it up the mountain as you can't push it on that moon like terrain unless the stroller has big wheels. And also, it is difficult to get on those 4x4s with your stroller. You can leave it at the place where you are able to hire the jacket.<br /><br />At the same place, use the toilet if you need to because I don't think there is one at the top for public use.<br /><br />If you are taking the bus from Catania or Nicolosi, you should know that there is only one bus up at the time I mentioned and the same bus sits on top of the mountain near a restaurant (which is further up than where it leaves the passengers) until 1630 hrs and returns the same way. We couldn't find an alternative way down to Nicolosi but spent some time in that restaurant where the driver of the bus kills time with his friends playing cards the whole day.

This is not to be missed.<br />Two things that are essential (at least in the summer, the season we went there). <br />Get up early because in the afternoon it clouds up and they might even close down the route.<br />Second, do NOT try to take the northern route as some tour books suggest as that area is impossible to get to. Go to the Refugio Sapienza and from there take the cable car (no booking necessary: it's continuous).<br />At the top you can continue with the SUVs there for a price, or if you're in walking shape, you can walk the to the highest point allowed (about an hour and a half one way).<br />And, oh yes, bring warm clothing. We were there in the midst of an otherwise scorching August and we were still cold (it was about 5-10 degrees at the top).<br />The parking? There are a couple spots really near the cable car and a &quot;parking attendant&quot; will help you manouver for a couple of Euros.

Take the opportunity to go to Etna and up on the cable car, which is the easiest route costs about 60 euros in all but in general worth it.<br />Stunning views but a bit too commercial. The guides are worth listening to but not for thoose who want more scientific knowledge.<br /><br />Took our own hire car and drove up the wiggle lanes to reach the ski resort from Zafferance and back via Nicolosi. Its not that difficult and worth doing.<br /><br />Went in September and some times you dont get the best views of Etna because of low cloud.<br /><br />You are allowed to walk the route up to Etna, but suggest you are good walkers with the right equipement as this is a mountain not a casual weekend hike. Good walking shoes, and usual mountain hiking rules apply. I would not want to walk this in the height of summer, the sun and the mountain would be far too hot but if you are young and fit go for it.

If you are visiting Taormina or Siracusa, don't miss a visit to the mighty Etna. I was not expecting much out of it but at the end I was impressed by the views and the experience of getting so close to the craters in a moon-like landscape. If you are coming by car it takes a while to make your way through the winding roads until you get to parking place next to Cratera Silvestri at 2000 meters which was interesting but not comparable to the top. From there you take a cable car and then a 4x4 shuttle bus to 2950 meters driving on a small road that goes through the lava fields. Several people do that part on foot but I don't recommend it if you have small children or you are not in a good shape, it is a long walk up. At the bus stop, a guide takes you to nearby craters (you will see steam coming out of the cracks on the ground) but the views and the topography made by the eruptions are quite amazing. If you want to continue and hike put to the top (3350mts) you need a guide but it gets much more challenging from there and we skipped the last part. It costs 60 euros for cable car plus shuttle or 29 euros for cable car only. A true experience where you realize nature's strength as you look down at the Sicilian coastline!

Driving up the Etna is quite a trip: the Mountain (as they call it in Catania) slopes directly from the sea up 3000 meters. While driving the changes are incredible as in a very short time we'll pass from seaman villages, to orange orchards, vineyards and real mountain villages. Then after a turn in Nicolosi we're on the moon or something very close to the Moon. Driving up the lava space and colours change from brown to grey to black and not in sequence. There are the remains of a forest with huge Pine trees and Huge Chestnut trees. The volcano is well organized and is possible to move all the way up in different ways. However is not at all recommended to go alone. The volcano is tricky and hides different dangers especially near the top. The best will be to spend the night and wait for sunrise. If the air is clear you can see all the way to Malta.

You know you'll regret it if you are this close and don't take advantage of one of the many guided tours on offer. We opted for the half-day morning tour, going to one of the craters on the slope of the mountain, which turned out to be just right as we are a bit too old to hike on to the top. Besides, clouds often move in quite swiftly, and those who do go on up often find they can't see a thing because they are enveloped in a cloud.

That is an extended analogue of a bus tour offered in Sicily: Taormina-Mount Etna. We made this trip with my wife mid-September 2012.<br /><br />We hired a Fiat 500 at Avis (office at Via Francesco Crispi 250) at 9am on Saturday (£40 for two days, I have my own annual insurance) and made our way along the sea shore and port towards the highway A19 to Catania. The streets are narrow and relatively well marked, so if you drive at a modest speed you will not miss it.<br /><br />The highway (autostrada) is quite good and the speed limit is 130km per hour which would allow you to get to Catania in two to three hours depending on the traffic. Once in Catania you'd better find parking rather than leave your car on the street. There are quite a few of them around the town centre and closer to the sea. We made a mistake of parking too far from the town centre and had to walk a distance. The normal parking charge is 0.75 to 1 euro per hour. We spent afternoon in the town and were off on the road at 5pm. We aimed at Paradise Camping which is situated in the lively area and has its own beach. To get there you have to take a highway Catania -Messina and exit roughly half way at Taormina. The highway is paid (c.1.7 euro). Once you exit the highway, immediately after the toll keep right and look for a brown sign Al Mare. Then on the first crossroad turn left in the direction of Messina. Keep driving for five km. Again, it is a narrow road along the sea so if you drive carefully you won't miss a sign 41km on your left and 'Paradiso Campeggio' on your right.<br /><br />The night in the camping for two people with a car and a tent will cost around 20 euro and you will get an immediate access to the beach, fantastic views of mainland Italy across the sea as well as a restaurant-pizzeria, bar, shop, and showers. You can play football and tennis there too.<br /><br />Early in the morning we left for Etna. We went back to Taormina and then drove towards Catania, exited at Giarre and followed the signs to Etna Sud (via Santa venerina - Zafferana Etna). The road is pretty good, but you have to be careful as you are moving up in the mountains. There is a lovely village you will pass by. I still regret that we didn't make a stop for coffee there. There are several parking spaces at the top of the volcano (Parking Crateri Silvestri), the first one being free. There are coffee-shops, restaurants and souvenir shops. Make sure you try pistachios in various forms - this taste is still with me.:) you can then either walk around and see recent craters or make your way up to the highest point (this is with a guide only).<br /><br />On the way back we got to Taormina, an old Greek town with a Greek amphitheatre, churches and pretty streets.<br /><br />We returned to the camping site late in the afternoon, spent it on the beach and then dined at the terrace over the sea. The restaurant prices are very modest there, so a dinner for two with no wine cost us c.20 euro. We went to sleep at 9pm to wake up at 5.30am so that we could return our car to Avis at 9am. Due to traffic first in Catania and then in Palermo we were a bit late though so you might think of starting earlier or having your car return time slightly later in the day.

On my recent trip to sicily one of the sights we visited was Mt Etna. As we had walked to the top of Mt Vesuvius in Naples I wasn't keen on seeing another volcano, the walk to the top of Mt Vesuvius put me off, but our guide assured me that was not the case in sicily. Well once I decided, the trip to the top was well worth it. You go up by cable car part of the way and then you transfer to special buses that take you the rest of the way on the volcanic soil. The feeling you get when you are there is one of absolute amazement it feels as though you are in another world.We walked around one of the craters( which by the way is still active) but if you decide to go to the top you need to take a coat of some sort as it gets very windy and cold.

If you plan a visit to Sicily you should definitely stop by. It is a once in a lifetime experience that everybody should live. You can organize the visit on your own: get to the bottom of the volcano (I drove from Nicolosi). Then buy a ticket for the first and second section of the climb: the first part is through a cable-way and the second with an off-road huge bus (pretty cool ride). You can also make the whole trip on foot but beware of the dust and the effort required. On the top the temperature is at least 15 degree lower than in the valley, and the view is astonishing if the weather is clear. The whole trip cost is about 60 euros but it's certainly worth it.

We had no problems with parking at cable station parking altough it was high season and just 5-6 days after the eruption (July 2011). We're not fond of hiking so bought the tickets for cable car and then jeep trip to go to the top, the guide there spoke Italian, French, English, German, he took us to some craters, showed the consequences of the last eruption and answered some questions, so it was just OK and after that we could roam there on our own, and we did. Do take some warm clothes with you, it's rather cold and don't forget about comfortable hiking shoes (sandals and flip-flops won't do), but don't worry if you haven't they rent shoes and coats at the jeep station.<br />There are good souvenir shops around parking with a lot of staff made of lava (bracelets, earings, necklaces, rings, key rings, etc).<br />There are some decent places to eat on the site.

On the day we visited Etna, it was very warm, and very very windy. We drove to Etna Sud, through fields of lava, with some fabulous views. There are a couple of craters at the parking level, which are free to walk round. We took the cable car for the first bit, to around 2600m which cost around 20€ per person. We had hoped to take the 4x4 for the last bit, up to the top (2900m), but we didn't for two reasons - one, our youngest has asthma - there are signs warning against going near the vents, with certain health conditions; and secondly, the cost - around 60€ per person!

We went up the north and south side of Mt Etna. The north side is not as touristy yet. You can see so much volcanic rock all over. It is a good experience without all the people. But you have to go to the south side to get the full experience.<br /><br />Yes, there are a lot of tourists. And it is expensive to go to the 3000 meter level, but it is well worth it. To walk around the craters and to imagine the power. The views are amazing. If you drive to the 2000 meter level, it is slow going with all the cars and buses. There is another road down that has less traffic and takes you to Nicolosi. I recomend this. As you reach Nicolosi, look to the left at a small restaurant-bar. It has outside seating and is a locals place. The best ice cream I have ever had! Try to find it. They do not speak english, but are so friendly.

You can see Mt Etna as soon as you land at Catania Airport, its an awesome sight and never becomes less so, our children were entranced by it. Would have loved to do an organised trip, but I dont think the children would really of appreciated or enjoyed it. So, we drove our hire car from Zafferana Etnea (where we were staying), to the quieter (and according to Lonely Planet) more picturesque side at Piano Provenzana. The route crossed lava fields, burnt out forests with amazing views. There wasnt much at the top, a few tourist souvenier kiosks, public toilets (not nice) and about 100m further up past the large public carpark, a pine chalet looking restaurant with a large outdoor terrace where we had a reasonable lunch. Apparently a company called STAR does 2 or 3 hour jeep and walking trips from here. From leaving our villa, to returning this trip, inc lunch took 4 hours.

We parked at the Riffuggio Sapienza and went up with the cableway, where we took the big trucks for the last track up to 2900m. We had a little tour with a guide around the area, which was short. Afterwards we stayed on the slopes and made a big tour on our own, even our son of 11 was very impressed by the fact that the vulcano was still active..... We had lunch at the cableway station on 2600 m with a marvelous view. After going back down we walked up the craters from the 2001/2002 eruptions, which lay close to the parking area. Still not crowdy, we left at 16.00 not being bored for one moment: it's a must when in Sicily!!

We went to mount Etna in August for a day trip from cefalu ( north Sicily). We chose the Etna Sud route because it seemed to have better logistics for tourists. We wanted to do a sunset tour but it was very difficult to get reliable information on details. We went to Taormina tourist info office and were told last fenicular leaves the station at 15.30 or 16.00. It turns out this is not true! (the last one leaves at 17.45 and from the top, the last departure is at 18.00). <br /><br />Anyway we went up by fenicular and the bus ( total 60.50- EUR) and this included a 45 min guided tour around one crater with s group. It was easy and interesting. A light jumper was enough for us ( and good shoes) so I do not think proper hiking gear and heavy clothing is necessary for this. When the bus took us down from the top, the fenicular closed so the bus took us down all the way to the station. <br /><br />Overall it was a great tour. It was surprising how difficult it was to find reliable info about this popular tourist destination, especially from the tourist office. Pretty sad really.

We drove to the base station where you take the cable car up. Cost per person was 60 Euro for the cable car, the bus to the craters and the guide. It is a nice experience and although very windy on the day we visited, it was a relief given the heat at the base station. We wore teeshirts and shorts, but coats etc were available for colder times of the year.

We had plans in the following weeks to climb Stromboli however some nice views of Etna during our stay in Taormina were definitely desirable. Mist and poor weather generally meant we could not get as good views as we’d hoped. We later learnt that the night before we had to leave our stay in Taormina, Etna erupted in the early hours – unbeknown to us! We missed it! We more than made up for this thankfully not long after during our amazing Stromboli visit where eruptions are ofcourse a regularity and can be viewed at close proximity.

There are many bus tours offering tours to Mt Etna, however we drove ourselves en route between Taormina and Siracusa. The giant car park surrounded by tourist and souvenir shops and litter does not auger well, and the 'chalet style' buildings offering ski and snow board hire in 40* temperature seemed rather surreal. <br /><br />We first walked around a crater that formed at the back of where a building now lies partly buried. We then searched for the trailhead of the path up to where the cable car finishes from the base. The charge for the cable car is around 30 euro and while I am sure that the views are stunning, walking gave an incredible sense of the rich black volcanic soil, the recent flows of lava and the resilience of small plants and flowers that seek to push through the hot ground in small patches.<br /><br />We mistakenly walked on a steeper, shorter track covered with scree underneath the chairlift for the first section, when we should have just followed the 4 wheel drive track from the back of the cable car the whole way. Winding up through the switchbacks it is a slow, but steady ascent, and the pungent smell of sulpher is apparent in places. It is very satisfying on reaching the summit of the cable car, and from here one can walk on further towards the mountain. <br /><br />Allow adequate time and take water with you. It is a spectacular place and well worth visiting.

We drove to the foot of the cable car at Rifugio Sapienza - there is a small charge of 2.50euro per half day for parking here,paid at an attendant ( no machines when we were there)- then walked up to the Funivia where we took the cable car up. Amazing views and scenery. There is a small cafee at the top of the Funivia( and several eating options at the bottom) but we had a small picnic with us which was a great experience perched up on stones. Make sure that whatever you bring is not going to blow away as even the smallest piece of lost food shows against the imacculate blackness of the scenery. <br /><br />We did not take the 4x4 bus option but there is plenty to hike up to at the top of the funivia, with spectacular views. It's expensive 28.50 euro and 15 Euro for children ) but we didn't regret it.<br /><br /><br />Good cloesd shoes are a must and make sure children have hats that don't fly away in the wind.<br /><br />We took refuge up on the mountain on a ver hot sicilian summer's day and it paid off: in Taormina were 37'C and up on Etna a mere 28'C with a delightful breeze. <br /><br />The tourist shops are ...touristy....but cheaper than the ones in Taormina.

Really - the Italian governments must be very poor as they cannot pay to clean up the rubbish that abounds everywhere. Etna of course is a marvelous experience, rubbish aside, but it does detract from the experience. And this observation holds true for much of Sicily - not unique to Etna. We drove our rental car up the mountain and hiked about and had a great time. The short cable car ride that brings you a bit further up the mountain seemed expensive - about $35 per person - so we passed on that. So what nature has to offer is bountiful, what humans have brought to this area is not so nice.

We did a tour with a company for convenience. It was anything but. The morning was fantastic and Mt Etna looked glorious in clear blue skies. The tour began at 7.30am. One hour to do pick ups, a stop at a gorge, Etna still under blue skies. Another detour to see how honey was made, clouds building. It was 1.30pm before we made the cable car station. Etna had its head in thick cloud - so dissapointing. We had limited time to explore before having to head back. Another hour of drop-offs... :-(<br /><br />Etna was spectacular and menacing - despite the cloud and the disinterested vulcanologist 'guide' couldn't give a fig about yet another group of tourists. <br /><br />Mt Etna is unmissable - it is a spectacular trip, but if you can - do it independently. I reckon for a group of four it would be cheaper to hire a car. Make sure you have good footware. A warm jacket can be hired for 2 Euros - when its cloudy you will need it. Brrr! A few on our tour had open sandals and the terrain is rough and can cut you to ribbons.<br /><br />The tourist shops at the foot of the cable car ARE missable.

It was a beautiful day when we visited mt Etna, but one bit of advice: we are a fit outdoors-family of five and the total trip with the cable car and Unimog-drives would've cost us €300. Instead we hiked as many people do. We did take the cable car half way up to save some time, but that would've not been necessary. The hike up was easy and safe and as nobody was allowed any further up the extra for a guide is not so important as the cable car company says.<br />The slope is not steep and with good shoes it's possible to cut corners and not follow the serpentine road. The ascend took us about 1,5 h and descend 0,5 h. Our friends with small children took the Unimog-drive for practical reasons and didn't feel they got any special guidance.<br />Our older children loved the hike and the view on the top was rewarding.

Cable car ride to mid mountain is 29 Euro. From there you can catch an all terrain vehicle to the top ( do not know what that price was) or you can walk via the ATV route which is about 3000 ft of vertical. That is not difficult as the roadway is not that steep. I climbed 1000 feet, but had to head back to Catania. It is certainly worth the vista. Views are great. From my vantage point, you can see the gasses escaping from the summit. The ride to the base is very interesting, with evidence of previous lava flows all around.

We stayed at Nicolosi 25 k's from Mt Etna. It took about half an hour to get to the parking place. We choose to go as early in the morning as possible and that was an advantage since it became more and more cloudy later on. We parked at the entrance from where the cable car was running. This cost us 27 Euros pp. After arriving to the place we were not planning to catch the 4WD bus/jeep to the top, because it cost too much, I think another 25 euros. We were just about to walk around and enjoy the view. <br />But we started out walking a few hundred meters just to get the feeling how it was like to walk at 2500 meters altitude. After that we walked a little more. We are 65+ so we rested a lot and in the end it was steeper so the lava stones kept rolling under our feet. After another ridge we were at the peak, almost 3000 m above sea level. That was surely an award: to walk around the ridge of the crater and look down into the smoking hole. (There had been four eruptions earlier this year but not from this hole.) <br />Bring WARM clothes if you end up walking! It's so much colder at this height. And bring wind proof clothing if you have! And don't forget something to eat and OF COURSE water!<br />The view and the experience was worth all the efforts!<br />By the way, it took us about 1,5 hours to climb, but we saw young people almost running to the top :)

When we started out driving to Mount Etna from Taormina region, we had not expected it to be so difficult to follow the road signs in order to reach what I guess might be classed as equivalent to 'base camp'. We managed the first bit on and off the main autostrada road, and followed the signs to Mount Etna. Then things got very confusing as signs said Mt Etna straight on, Mt Etna south, Mt Etna north and so forth so we were confused as to which way we should turn. So we decided to go the straightest route possible and ended up going away from the mountain . Finally after talking to several people, we found the right road which was Mt Etna South for which there appeared to be very few clear signs and unless one was in the know, one would have no way of knowing that this was the one to get you to the right place in Mt Etna National Park. En route up to base camp we encountered very little traffic so we thought this was a positive sign that what we would find would be minimal in terms of eating and drinking establishments and other tourist locations and that we would be able to soak in this giant of nature's powers in relative peace and quiet. How surprised we were when we finally made it round the last corner only to be met by masses of restaurants, bars, a cable car station, tour guide stalls and simply masses of tour coaches! We flinched at the high cost of the cable car that would have taken us up to a somewhat higher level and flinched even more at the cost of taking a jeep from there a bit further up. So we walked around the smaller accessible crater at base camp trying to stay peacefully apart from the hoards of tourists around us. Yes, I know we too were part of those tourist numbers so I don't want to appear too critical as that would be hypocritical. What was upsetting though, was the amount of rubbish encountered all around the Mount Etna National Park area. In the presence of such an awe inspiring symbol of Nature's uncompromising power, this lack of care seemed to demonstrate a lack of respect for nature and for other fellow human beings and it made one embarrassed to be part of the human race in whose hands the future of our earth has been placed. It certainly was an experience worthwhile despite all the negative issues. I experienced the ever changing colours of the volcanic rocks and the shapes created by the craters and dune-like formations. For Nature's own design I would have given a five star rating of course.

My family and I were very pleased with the tour we booked with Coop.Sicily Life to see Mt. Etna and Taromina. The driver, Antonio, was waiting for us when our ship docked at Messina. He was very knowledgeable, his English was excellent, and he was very accommodating to our specific requests during the tour. He waited patiently while our 15 year old granddaughter climbed the volcano twice and took us to a vantage point where we could get a good photograph of our ship. I am so glad we decided to book with you instead of taking the ship excursion.

We recently visited Sicily, what a crazy city, crazy drivers &amp; passionate people. When driving around Sicily, you cannot help notice such magnificent views of Mount Etna, it sometimes felt like the mountain was following us. We visited Mount Etna North, not a lot to do, there are a few stalls around and a take away food/bar, we took a 4 wheel drive tour up to the mountain at a cost of 55 Euro/person, we experienced the most spectacular views of a steaming black mountain surrounded by smaller mountains &amp; craters, and walked up and around the crater that erupted in 2002, this was an amazing experience, it was worth every penny and would recommend it to anyone who is not afraid of heights.

We flew from Naples to Catania and then travelled from Catania to a villa we had rented for a week in Taormina. The views of Mount Etna were beautiful right from the parking lot of the airport! While in Taormina, Mount Etna erupted overnight and we woke with a black sugar-like substance covering our terrace and car! It didn't matter where we travelled, smokey Mount Etna seemed to follow us. We never had time to take a tour up it but certainly enjoyed it's beauty during our visit to Sicily. One of the friends we were travelling with had done the tour a few years ago and loved it.

What can i say - it's an active volcano almost 3000 metres high and by cable car and 4WD bus/jeep you can get to within a few hundred metres of the top!<br />We had a beautiful clear and windless day, but even then it was chilly at the top. yes the cable car and 4wd are quite dear (E85 total for me and 14 year old wheelchair using son and my husband an 16 year old son paid just about E100 I think for the guided walk tour, which they throroughly enjoyed..up on cable car and bus and then walk down) but it was one of the highlights and reasons for the trip so we paid and didn;t think about it too much!<br />You can walk up if you are able to, but at the moment no-one can go higher really than where the bus gets to cos of the regular little eruptions.<br />None of it is particularly wheelchair freindly but we found everyone very helpful. To get to the cabel car station is up loads of steps but you can get a car to the bottom of the top set if a barrier is opened and so I went and asked and the barrier was lifted and we were told we couldpark as near as we wanted to the bottom of the steps.<br />husband and older son had gone on their tour so i took younger son (who can take a few steps with support) up the steps and then sat him donw while i retrieved his wheelchair. A few offer s of help from other visitors. We then got tickets and taken by way of the exit steps (as opposed to the chokka entrance steps) to where the cable cars go from. I was asked if i neede help to carry my son - i said no but you can carry the chair up thanks, which he duly did!<br />They then put the chair in one cable car and then my son and i in the next (fantsatic views up and down) and then when we got to the top they got the chair out and helped us out, slowing the cable car a bit more. It is level access at the top. There are loos, not sure if there is disabled or not but in Italy you use whatever loo is available i have found!<br />We then went to the place where the 4WD buses go from and again lots of helpful staff - they carried my son onto the bus, i collapsed the chair and then they stowed it for me - not even allowing me (in the nicest way) to carry any of the bits up the bus steps. then at the other end, same thing and in fact I found that another tourist had got the chair put together (seat and back have to come off to fold) ready and waiting for us! Going back down was this in reverse.<br />Views from top are amazing, but you can;t get far with a chair as the ground is too rough and steep but it was OK for a few photos and the view.<br />At the bottom we ate at the rifugio...very nice food and very helpful re access.<br />if you go to Sicily you really should aim to get as far up Etna as you can.

If you want a trip to Mount Etna with a guide who is knowledgable and passionate about his country then look no further than Maurizio of BDM Sicily.<br /><br />My wife and I went on a day's trip to Etna along with two really friendly Irish girls who were more dressed for the beach than a trip up a volcano!<br /><br />Maurizio picked us up from our hotel, The Panoramic, which was outstanding, and drove us to Etna with a continual commentary of the Countryside and history of the region surrounding Etna as well as developing a great rapport with his guests along the way.<br /><br />At 1800 metres up Etna we joined a 4 by 4 top go to 2900 metres and Maurizio accompanied us as the english speaking guide and continued to entertain us and other travellers with his knowledge of Etna. The scenery was like nothing else we have ever seen and if you really want to appreciate the force of an active volcano then this trip is perfect.<br /><br />After descending back to 1800 metres Maurizio took the 4 of use for a fabulous lunch at a nearby restaurant at a discounted price of 10 euros each including wine which we all thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />After that we continued our journey through the foothills of Etna and visited the stunning Gole dell' Alcantara and paddled in the icy cold waters of the gorge whilst admiring the rock formations overhead.<br /><br />After that we returned to Taormina having experienced a fabulous day in the company of Maurizio. We hope to return to Sicily agian in the not to distant future and we will certainly be calling upon Maurizio's service again.

Our B&amp;B host helped us book a guide for the trip, which was most helpful. We wouldn't have known what we were seeing without him, and he took us to several locations around the south side of the volcano. There have been about 7 eruptions in the last 230 years and Paolo, our guide, was able to tell us which lava came from which eruption by how much plant growth was on it. We were also able to go inside a lava cave with flashlights and a hard hat and see different formations (blisters, stalactites, etc.) inside the cave <br />It was interesting to climb on the lava, but be careful! It is sharp and unforgiving if you fall on it! It's best to have sturdy shoes. It was also very windy and cold (there was snow in the middle of May) so bring a jacket and cap that won't blow off. There is a gift shop that was saved from the lava flow in 2002 by building a 20 ft. high wall in a wedge shape on the upper side of it so the lava flowed around it. You can see the building and a small green patch around it. That was the only time in history man has ever controlled the flow of lava.

We booked a trip to Sicily (Taoramina) just before Mt. Etna erupted. Still we went and had a great time. We read we should take the opportunity to see the mountain directly. Instread of a guided tour we took our rented car and drove up the mountain. First by doing this we saw some great local Sicilian mountainside towns. Lots of fun. Then after many kms of winding roads we got near to the top of Mt. Enta where we could see (and touch) the cool (still a bit warm) lava rock from the flows. There's also some snow up there. We were able to make snowballs crusted with lava. There are also bathrooms and small shops for water and ice cream. Very surreal - and fun!

Took a private tour to Mount Etna in the morning then on to Taormina for the afternoon. The journey up the mountain took for ever. It was very windy at the top, not sure if this is the usual. We could only stay there for a few minutes as it was very cold and the wind was so strong it nearly blew me of my feet. If you really want to see Mount Eta, take some very warm clothes for this tour.

Since we lived in Cefalù the day started early. When we arrived to Etna we had an option to go to the top of the mountain and even though it did cost it was well worth it. The weather did what it could to help us decide, The sun was shining and at the top we could see Catania and the Mediterranian. If you are considering to go to Etna don't forget to bring a jacket because even though it's warm at the beach it's pretty cold on the top of the mountain.

It's amazing such a location, (the cone of an active volcano) is so easy to visit.<br /><br />Just drive up to the bottom of the lift, buy a ticket for 60 euro's each and you get a lift up to 2500m followed by a cool 4wd trip up next to the summit at 3000m. From there a guide takes you for a walk around the 2001 eruption crater with vies into the still fuming center. The walk continues around the rim of the crater where you can see the cone of the 2003 eruption. Of interest during the walk is the fact that your feet are warm and when touching the ground its probably 50-60 deg C. (the mountain lets you know its still very active.)<br /> <br />My boys got to touch snow for the first time, on the same day it was 28 deg C in Catania, It's cool so remember your jacket and jumper.<br /><br />Beach and the snow on the same day, you don't get that at many places.

We weren't expecting snow in April but there was more snow poiled up at the side of the road than in Chamonix in February when we got to the Refuge Sapienza! It was bitterly cold and the chair lift was not working because of the wind so we could not go further than the refuge. It was still amazing to just drive there (and we didn't need snow tyres - the roads are cleared quickly of snow and ashes (regularly deposited on the roads)). Seeing the little towns built of dark, volcanic rock lower down and then the many abandonned houses higher up and the lunar landscape is amazing!<br /><br />If you have a car then this is a 'must-do'.

I'll start by saying I have a big fear of heights. (bad experience a few years ago getting lost in the Pyrenees Mountains) The drive up from Taormina is great if you take your time. Make sure you use your GPS and the signs that are posted eveywhere. Your GPS will take you right through some little villages along the way but try to stick to the yellow roads. There is only one main road that goes up the south side and its very well marked with side rails the entire way and room for you to pull over if you have those impatient drivers behind you. Once at that level you come across all of the usual touristy shops with everything imaginable made out of volcanic rock. From there we took a gondola ride up the volcano to the first level. Being afraid of heights I spent most of the ride staring at my feet but it was a fairly smooth ride and my husband was delighted with the view. Once you arrive at the next level you have the option of enjoying a nice glass of wine, cappuccino, some of the best sandwiches you will find in Italy or just ....enjoy the view. One other option you can go HIGHER!! After a glass of liquid courage and the hopeless look on my husbands face I agreed to take the bus/jeep ride to the highest point. Now as I said I am afraid of heights but after seeing seniors, children and so many eager little faces I know this was Etna and my only chance to witness its glory. I have to say it wasn't that bad, they take their time , giant wheels that could have gotten through any blizzard in Ontario so I felt more secure. Once to the top their are guides to meet you and walk you around some of the craters and there definitely is a need for a warm coat and gloves. You can venture out as much as you like as there is continuous buses back and forth to take you back to the starting point. It sure makes you realize we are all so small in the big picture. The landscape is like nothing you will ever see again and I'm amazed at the people who live in the shadow of this Great one. So my recommendation is to go for it. Have that little glass of liquid courage as I did , I did reach the bottom in one piece and I'm still waiting for that shiny little bauble that I think I more then deserve.

Mt Etna was one of the main reasons I visited Sicily (the other being Stromboli) and I feel a bit bad rating it as less than 5 out of 5. I went on the public bus from Catania Station. The bus station is pretty chaotic and I found the bus by looking for other people with walking poles. The bus left from Bay 3 the day I went but I don’t know if that is a regular spot. I had been told I could buy a ticket on the bus but luckily discovered in good time that I needed to brave the traffic to buy one from across the street. The bus was very crowded. It stopped for about 20 minutes in Nicolosi and there is a café where you would have time to get coffee/breakfast.<br />At Rifugio Sapienza there are several places to get food and drinks (and use the toilets). I went in the main building and had an acceptable coffee and a truly excellent chocolate croissant. Later I ate in a place which said “fast food” on the outside and had an acceptable plate of pasta. Considering the location I didn’t think the food and drink were overly expensive.<br />The cable car and bus is expensive. When I went I paid €60.50 and I have the impression the price is rising all the time. The queuing was chaotic but the lady on the desk was doing an excellent job of serving several people (in several languages) at once. The cable car ride was fine. At the top of the cable car there was another food, drink and toilet opportunity. <br />I may have missed something with the buses that went further up. I queued up and got on a bus but I wasn’t sure if it was just a shuttle service or there was any guide involved. The ticket included a guide fee but I decided that might be just in case you need rescuing. After wandering around for a bit and getting very cold, despite having decent clothing, I got a bus back down to the cable car. <br />Back down at the Rifugio Sapienza I walked up the two small craters – Silvestri and the Crater of 2001 – which was very enjoyable.<br />I’m glad I went but I can’t help feeling I could have done better.<br />

On our last day on the island we went to Etna, and it was the best day of the holiday. We went on a monday, on quite a cool day (for Sicily anyway) and it was really quiet. All the way up to the base camp type area at the south side we had spectacular views. Once parked up we found craters to walk around and buses selling flavoured honey with the sellers giving out lots of free samples. There were many souvenir huts which pretty much sold exactly the same goods in each shop. Since it was so windy the cable cars were out of operation and we took vehicles the whole way which minibuses crossed with jeeps, and a lot of fun (although crazy exspensive, over 100 euros for the two of us!!) We were meant to have a guide at the top but it was so windy it was kicking up a sandstorm outside and we couldn't even open our eyes so pretty much stayed inside the bus which was a bit of a let down, but that couldn't be helped. It was beautiful and worth the money as a one-off experience. If the weather was calmer I would consider hiking the upper part of the journey.

We took the gondola up and then walked up a little, we really felt the altitude, and so did the kids (both asleep in the car after running around at 2'500m).

We boooked the Taormina tour on-line during a cruise stop in Messina. Although our expectations were low about visiting Sicily, it turned out to be the best day of the entire cruise due to the wonderful service provided by Sicily Limousine Services. Their guide Claudio picked the four of us up at the dock in a luxurious Mercedes mini-van and his excellent narration complemented the wonderful vistas of Taormina and its surroundings. All of this at a per person cost of half that of what the cruise line charged for a similar excursion with 40 other people on a bus.

We went to taormine for our honeymoon at the start of may and decided to take a tour to mount Etna. We booked it in taormine at a local tour office and paid 34euros each. We met at the local bus terminal at 8am and took our place on the bus. We stopped on the way to a house which had been spared from one of the lava flows by just 3meters! it was amazing to see how close it came to destroying the house. There was lovely honey being sold from 6euro upwards. Next stop was mount Etna, as we approached the parking spot our guide informed us that that was as far as they go and its now up to us if we wanted to spend more money reaching the top. It was 32.50euro per person to get on the cable car to bring us up to the next level and then a further 32.50euro per person to get to the next level in a truck so that's nearly 200euro for two people to go to the top of mount Etna, Im making you all aware that when you pay for your trip it only gets you to the parking place on mount Etna. There are two craters for you to see on that level but really when we booked the trip we taught it ment a trip to mount Etna and not just to a parking level. We where given a voucher for the restaurant of choice by the tour guide with a small discount but found the food wasn't great and quite expensive we actually got more value for money at a different one on site with out a discount.

She had errupted 2 weeks prior to our visit. Once there we went round some of the craters that had been made by erruptions, these are huge. The views from here are lovely. We had a great guide who was from the village below Etna and his knowledge was amazing. He explained that Etna had never killed anyone. It is a strange place as it it warm but there is still alot of snow. This is really worth a visit and you need to try the Force of volcano liqueor 50% vol!!!!!

We stopped at a number of lava flows from various eruptions, and snow-shoed up toward the main crater. Lunch was a wine-tasting with delicious, plentiful antipasta.

Whilst on holiday in Malta about five years ago, I took the excursion to Sicily. I caught the early morning 'fastest ferry in the world' to Sicily, good crossing but all enclosed, no hiding up on the deck in case of sea sickness. Itravelled by coach to Mount Etna, the bus went up surprisingly far, to the shopping and Hotel complex being built there, already there were lots of souvenir shops and eateries of all descriptions. The views were amazing, sitting there in the blistering heat overlooking Sicily, a truly magical moment. The next place we stopped was Taormina. The little place is class personified, it was absolutely beautiful. There were lots of classy shops, and beautiful people walking about. I sat on the Plaza overlooking the med, so peaceful although there were street entertainers, and happy people clapping away and dancing to the musicians. Sadly only stayed there for a few hours, driving back, we watched as Mount Etna erupted, apparently, it erupts everyday, it was wonderful to see mother nature perform for us.

The open trail takes you to a viewing point, a nice hike up to a crater that will leave you covered in black dust from head to toe (comes off quickly when going for a swim afterwards). Or you do as the annoying hords of lazy tourist: go by noisy, speedy trucks. For a closer look at the vulcanoe, you need a registered guide. Good idea to check prizes and book in advance.

3 friends and I had a great trip with Sebastiano. We were visiting the area via a cruise and booked the tour ahead of our visit. He met us at the port and we first headed for Mt. Etna. Driving is a bit more assertive there than in my rural town but it didn't seem much different than what everyone was doing. We stopped in a small village to stretch our legs and for some photos. Then stopped at a honey store (which was surprisingly a great store - I brought some home, tremendous fruit creams). Got up to the top of the mountain - after driving through some terrible fog, it was beautifully clear at the top. Then stopped at Taormina on the way back - best cannoli ever, found some great ornaments as gifts for back home (all the stores visited shipped back to US). He had us back to the ship at the time we requested. It was a great day and a great value. I would recommend him and would use him again if I'm so lucky as to go back!

I know that there are trips up the mountain that involve less physical activity, but consider that the hiking is uphill and in rocky terrain. However, it really is a beautiful and amazing place to visit! Just be prepared and wear the appropriate shoes!

May/June is the ideal time to visit Sicily as all the spring flowers are in bloom. On Etna you get a great variety and as you go higher different plants are in bloom. There are many good waymarked walks which are not too difficult - you vary the length according to ability. There is also the fascination of the different ages of lava flows with gradual re-colinisation by plants as the lava ages. <br />At this time of year the weather tends to be ideal for mountain walking - we tended to to only need T shirts and shorts although you would need a bit more if you went higher. You need proper footwear to walk on lava - new lava can be sharp! - but not all walks are on lava.<br />Views of Etna from anywhere around are impressive with often a hint of steam escaping ( and the everpresent chance of something more dramatic happening -see Jan. 2012) . Much of the walking is open - only a few trees - so the outward views especially on the seaward side are beautiful. You must have trekking poles, sun hats, sunscreen and water extra clothing, waterproofs as a minimum if you are walking seriously.<br />There is a mountain rescue service - they checked we were ok on an earlier visit after a thunderstorm ( that was in April).<br />The people were very friendly and you can generally get by without speaking Italian.<br />And of course you can stay at the sea and mix walking with beach pleasures - it takes less than an hour to drive to the start of most walks.<br />All in all a very nice place to visit.

If you visit Mt Etna on a clear day, it would seem to be a fantastic time. Unfortunately, we day we went, the weather was terrible and our visibiliy was nearly zero. Though we got to see a few things, we could not capture the full scale of what we were seeing due to the intense fog and cloud cover. <br /><br />I would definitely recommend this excursion, but make sure the weather is going to be clear. If the weather calls for rain or clouds, work to reschedule. Also, if you do this visist through one of the excursion companies, you will need to be in good shape and there is a considerable amount of walking and the terrain can be a bit rough.

Fantastic just to drive up the mountain throught the changing scenery - becoming more lunar like and sinister as you approach the top. You will need to get a parking ticket from the nearby ticket office to leave in your car. Cable cars take visitors to near the top and special four wheel drive vehicles take you the rest of the way almost to top. The cable cars were not operating when it was time for us to come down due to high winds. The four wheel drives had to do double duty to take us down.It was incredibly cold at the top because of these winds and the tourists were happy to sit down on the volcanic gravel for fear of literally being blown over the side. Looking down into a live volcanic vent that had erupted in the last few days was definitely worth the minor discomfort though. The recent activity had coated the remaining snow with ash with some of the snow still peeking through. Definitely a highlight of the trip and recommended.

We were situated on the northern side of Mount Etna and so drove up the the highest point that you can by car, they have renewed the ski village there following the last eruption but there did not appear to be much for tourists, ( possibly between seasons.)<br />I spoke to someone who had just returned from the trip in the 4 wheeled drive vehicle, she said that although she had pre-paid the guide had demanded that she pay an extra fee for the guide!<br />Later in the week we tried the southern side of Etna as according to the map there was a cable car there which we thought might be less expensive, after a pleasant, but very rainy and cloudy drive around the base we finally arrived at the highest point for cars.<br />We were immediately approached by a man demanding euros for parking the car in the Etna car park, ( not the main car park which had a board with various parking prices on depending how long you intended to stay)<br />We went to the pay desk and were surprised by the high cost of the trip which for the cable car which took you so far, then the 4 x wheel drive and the costs for a guide, which was a compulsory 18 euros totalled almost 50 euros each, we had also been informed that this was to go to about 200 metres from the edge of the volcano. We decided against the trip as the weather was appalling and the cloud was surrounding the summit so we would not have been able to see much.<br />Whilst I was there a German couple with 2 children came to the pay desk and asked how much it would be for the children, they were told half price up to 7 years old but would not accept their word that he was only 7 ( as he was quite tall ) so they paid almost 175 euros <br />All in all we were disappointed in our holiday in Sicily, as Mount Etna was the main reason to go there, apart from the hotel, Feudo Vagliasindi near Randazzo, which was excellent, certainly on this side of the island much of the tourist trade is lost by lack of development of the area and the high cost of things.( some we believe were overcharging purposely )

To reach the most impressive views, you must travel via shuttle bus and cable car, plan on a full day outing. Bring comfortable walking shoes, a camera, dress in layers and bring water. Along the trails, we observed the smoldering effects of volcanic activity and noted lady bugs! It was a memorable experience and a highlight of our trip, especially since Etna is one of the most actvie volcanoes in Europe and the highest mountain in Italy south of the Alps.

We wanted to see Mount Etna whilst holidaying in Southern Sicily. We hired a car and drove to Rifugio Sapienza. This, incidentally is not on the GPS, so we had some difficulty initially. The signage can be sometimes confusing and perhaps the tourism authority could improve on this. The drive up itself was spectacular, with the changing landscape. As it was autumn, we saw the autumn leaves turning yellow interspersed with the greenery. Rifugio Sapienza itself is about 1,900 metres and beyond that one has to go up by cable car. We chose not to as there was a heavy cloud cover at the top. Etna is cold in November. So please come well prepared. [---]

How strange!?<br />The day after we left, Etna erupted, I was sorry that I just could not see it. I wondered how people are not afraid to live near active vulcano, they answer me that they do not have fear of the eruption as the earthquake that eruption causes.

Others offer guidance on tour companies. I'd simply like to say that making the effort to visit Etna is very worthwhile. It's like being on the moon...with vegetation. Many of the plants, animals and insects you may see are unique to the area surrounding Etna. Be sure to have something warm to wear as you'll need it when the fog and mists swirl about. The restaurant at the parking area had good food at reasonable prices...and a warm fire in the hearth. Try the arancini...rice balls containing meat and sauce and cheese...coated with bread crumbs and deep fried.

I went in a 4-wheel drive car, in company with the guide and a family. (I was the oldest member of the party, by quite a few years). We were taken to some absolutely brilliant places near to the different lava flows of recent years. The guide was informative and informed, answering my occasionally tricky geological questions without hesitation. We were unable to go above 2500m because of ongoing eruptions. But seeing the steam rising from the craters above us, an eagle in the distance, the fresh ash from recent eruptions, the house about 5 metres from the last big flow, and going down into a lave 'cave' - it was well worth every cent of the €50 that it cost.

Etna is an active volcano and occasionally it was exploding, we could see the lava going down from kilometers away on the street. Then we went up to the mountain as well! You use the cable lift to go up and it is exciting. Then you either climb up by foot or by a car that you pay for. We walked. It was very nice walk.

If you are in the area, I would highly recommend taking an all day tour. And make sure to pay for the gondola and jeep tour all the way to the top. Great, surreal views! You can see all the hundreds of craters and get very close to them. The lava is warm to the touch. If you don't have warm clothes, you can rent a winter coat for EUR2 as well as hiking boots (but those are not essential, it's an easy walk).

After sitting in Taormina for 4 days watching Mt Etna covered in cloud, we drove up at the first sign of the peak. We skipped the option of paying around €170 for a tour guide as most only take you to the 1900 metre mark.<br /><br />By the time we arrived,the cloud/ fog etc was so thick it was basically a white out. The cloud came and went so quickly at one state you could see the cars 20ft away and next, not at all. As soon as you turn in there is a cafe and a crater from 1986. We were shocked to see most people visit this and then leave, but the weather was bad. <br /><br />Due to bad weather we could only go up the ski lift, the trucks weren't working. So watched the video then left. ski lift without the truck €28, with truck €53<br />However having travelled from Australia and etna being one of the few things on the list to tick off, we were coming back. <br />We returned next day which was crystal clear. Set off about 8am from Taormina, hardly any clouds in sky, but by noon when we came down from the peak, the clouds had come in thick and fast, so BIG tip if you see it clear drive fast and get to the top. However despite ski lift and trucks both working and it being clear at top, when we came down the ski lift, the cloud was so thick you would have no idea how clear it was at peak.<br />They obviously don't let people go up if it's unsafe or poor visibility so would take the advice of people at the ski lift. <br />We had to drive to Palermo so had planned a very quick visit this second time, and apparently once u get to the top with the trucks, you could literally jump on a truck and head back down, which seems pointless. The guides meet you at top and do a 40 min walk around the craters which is great.....apart from fact we were too excited so lost our guide so ended up just walking around ourselves, but we had no prob with this nor did we feel like we'd missed out on anything.<br />The video at top of ski lift is very good so watch it.<br />The cafe at bottom, LHS from ski lift thru car park serves good basic food, but hot chocolate disgusting!

We did the trip in 4-wheel drive vehicles with STAR from the north side (Piano Provenzana). When we arrived at 10:30am, the sullen lady in the ticket office told us that the trip was €50 each for a 1 hr 45 minute excursion. Plus a further €4 to park the car! The ticket included €6 for the guide, who's contribution was little more than reading out the brief signs that were posted at the stops.<br />The trip was interesting, especially the walk around the 2002 crater. However, it was all over in 1 hr 15 min. The excursion did not &quot;continue to the summit&quot; from Piano delle Concazze as advertised in the brochure for STAR.<br />I'm glad that we went up - but in future would research more thoroughly and hike to the summit with a guide. This may only be available from the south side - certainly wasn't offered as an option to us when we arrived at 10:30am. <br />We did enjoy a self guided walk around Monti Sartorious (set off from Refugio Citelli) - and just driving around the high mountain roads on Etna is a worthwhile experience.

I have to admit that I wasn't prepared for such beautiful views. It was really amazing. We went on an excursion with Etna Experience &lt;http://www.etnaexperience.com/english/HOME.html&gt;, which was around 60 euro, but I cannot begin to describe the fun we had, and how much it was worth it. They took us off-roading on lava; we went in caves; walked on craters ... it was beautiful. If you are ever interested in seeing Mount Etna, I think this is the fullest experience you can get - I'm positive that we would have missed out on a great deal of interesting and impressive information and facts if we had gone on our own. We went in early September so it wasn't cold, and it wasn't windy when we were walking on the craters either. Trekking shoes, or at least very comfortable walking shoes are a must, and try to wear clothes that you don't mind getting dirty. If it's summer, put your swimsuit on and head to the ever impressive Alcantara river afterwards for a true full Etna experience!

Climbing an active volcano is something you shouldn't miss, so take the trip.<br />I would recommend to buy tickets for the ski lift and the trucks taking you up to the interesting area. Walking is not worth the effort unless you're very interested in the exercise. A bit too large groups made the guide hard to hear and the tour felt a bit rushed. However, you can stay and walk around by your self if you have arrived by your own means. Don't miss to touch the ground and feel the heat. Also bring proper shoes and some warm clothes. The altitude and the fact that the volcano catches and make its own clouds make the area cold and shady.

Just drive to Etna's visitor center to buy tickets and go up. We took the ski lift and then jeeps to almost the top with the guided tour. the top was currently closed because there had been an eruption a few days before and they were expecting another the next day. The crater from 2002 was still venting steam, and they give you lots of really interesting info about past eruptions. Would DEFINATELY recommend!!! This was one of our favorite things we did! Having hiked up a really tall volcano before we knew HOW TIRING it is so we paid the little bit extra to take the jeeps. TOTALLY WORTH IT. Some people that hiked up tried to take the bus down-but they wouldn't let them since they hadn't paid. VERY IMPORTANT: you go up to around 10,000 ft. in altitude-even during the summer it is FRIGID, take a fleece, or jacket, or coat or SOMETHING! And consider long pants and tennis shoes, NOT SANDALS! lava and volcanic ash are sharp. there are some cool videos of past eruptions playing at the station at the top of the ski lift where the jeeps leave from, hang out and watch them!

It woud be a sin to visit this region of Sicily and not visit Mount Etna. It is an amazing, unforgettable experience. If (like us) you've done Vesuvius in the past, and think that one volcano is pretty much like another....well, they're not. Not only are they completely different types of volcano, the landscape up there and the experience you have of the visit is totally different. I'll not compare here as people can read about Vesuvius if they are interested, as this is about Etna. (But if you are in the Naples region, Vesuvius is also a not-to-be-missed trip),<br /><br />There are several different ways of getting to Etna. The easiest is probably through an organised excursion. We decided (unusually for us) to go with the travel company that we had booked out holiday through. This ensured an easy trip, comfy coaches and an excellent guide., The downside of course is that you lose your autonomy to wander at will and you have to do the stops they plan for you and stick to their times. But.....the stops turned out to be quite nice and we weren't herded around. We had plenty of time on Etna. You can also book trips through various companies in your resort. They seemed to offer and pretty similar itinerary and prices were sometimes a little cheaper but I don't know what they are like.<br /><br />If you have a car you can also drive yourself to the main car park area and then go the rest of the journey up the mountain yourself. There are loads of shops and restaurants here (at about 2000 ft) and you are advised to stop here for at least half an hour to adjust to the altitude. Some people stay here and look around. Views are stunning and you can walk around one of Etna's many 'children' - her cones and craters from previous eruptions.<br /><br />From here, if you wish, you can go further up the mountain to about 3000ft to get into the real, barren lunar landscape of Etna. You have to get the cable car first, from the cable car station. At the top of the cable car ride (it takes about 15 minutes) there is a restaurant and the last toilets on Etna! There are none at the top! You then you pick up a sort of land rover/all terrein bus type vehicle which winds it's way up to the top. This took about a further 25 minutes, but the driver was going very slowly due to some mist and cloud...thankfully...it is a precipitous, steep and winding road. <br /><br />At the top you are met by a Volcanologist who will take you around the smoking craters.You are not allowed to stray from the paths or go near the main crater - this is an active volcano and it would be foolhardy to be macho. However, there are plenty of paths that you can follow and the brave/very fit/mad can even walk up a trail from the 2000ft point. The paths are quite tricky. The lava underfoot is like scree and a bit tricky and slippy. There are steep slopes into craters on either side of you and no fences. I was very surprised to see very young children up there, even toddlers.The paths are not even that wide and I was a bit scared. It's fine if you are careful and sensible but I'm not sure I'd like to take youngsters up there. It might also be hard for people with mobility or health problems. The terrain is not easy and you do feel the altitude. (It's a bit like you've just drank a hefty helping of Limoncello). There are warnings for people with asthma, heart conditions etc. The guides do carry walkie talkies and I suspect that anyone in trouble would get help very quickly, but it'd spoil the day out! Best to take advice if you're not sure, before going up.<br /><br />You do need good walking shoes (but not special ones - just comfortable and sturdy. Trainers are fine. Flip flops won't do!) You also want to take something warm to put on. Even in August it can be very cold up there. Take water and allow a good couple of hours if you want to walk around the craters. Take the camera - views are out of this world. Make sure you reach down and feel the hardened lumps of lava - they are warm. If you dig a little hole it getrs hotter still. Amazing!<br /><br />Etna is like a vast desert of blackness. It is like the moon. There are countless craters and the landscape changes all the time with each eruption. I mentioned Vesuvius earlier, which is a trail up to a distinct cone. This is a barren, steaming (with sulphur) whole other world. You can even see the tops of buildings lost in the 2001/2 eruption. In fact, under the lava under your feet are the souvineer shops and ski stations that used to be there. (But thankfully just that - no one was hurt in that eruption, apparently.)<br /><br />By the way, you don't have to walk around at 3000ft. You can just hang out by the land rover thingy, admire the view and take some pics if you want. The vehicles go up and down all day. They just wait to fill up each time and then they're off.<br /><br />Finally, always keep your eye on Etna throughout your time in Sicily. On our last day, two days after our trip, we were rewarded by an eruption. She decided to give us a little show one morning and threw out a huge, grey ash cloud, clearly visible in the clear blue sky. By the evening she'd settled down again to her little constant puff of sulphur. We were told she does this often (her third burp in August alone) and rarely does she interfere with travel and flights. Which is a pity because a few more days on Sicily would have been nice!

A trip around Mt Etna is highly recommended. A local train called Circumetnae was an amazing way to see some small villages and get excellent views of Mt Etna and surrounding areas. From the central station we took a train to Giarre (2.65 euro) where we boarded the Mt Etna train (Circumetnae is a very short walk to the right from Giarre station. Also had lunch in Giarre at Don Carmelo......some of the best Italian food we experienced and the owners are so much fun.

For people considering a day trip to Etna on their own, the most common point of departure is Catania (summarised in the post by Mat P, though i will add a few things), where people catch a bus to the Refugio Sapeinza base. <br /><br />Options for the Southern approach:<br />- Try one of the towns surrounding the base of the mountain. There is a connecting bus service that runs around the mountain. The towns are small and don't have the big city feel of Catania. I went through Nicolosi that has a bus service running up to Etna.<br />- Catching the bus up from Catania: The Cable car + 4WD Jeep + Guide costs 53 EUR pp which you book from the base of the cable car at Refugio. Even though the bus to Etna only costs 3.60 EUR, the big hit to your wallet will be getting up the mountain. Be aware that walking to the end of the cable car is 2 hours and then there is another 1 hour walk to the summit. Coming down is faster but pretty unpleasant since it will basically be gravel all the way down. Note that the timing of buses from Catania pretty much forces you to get the cable car because you have to be back down by 4:30pm.<br />- Driving yourself: if you are in a group this is probably your best option. There is parking available at the top (the Refugio Sapienza base) and you have the option of bringing your own food easily with your own car. The food at the top is expensive and pretty ordinary. Also, you have the option of stopping on the way up for photos and things. Watch out for a house that is buried by lava. It is actually two storeys tall but you can only see the upper level! The other advantage is that you don't have to rush down for the 4:30pm bus so if you like to hike (and save 28 Euros on the cable car) you can do this.<br />- Staying at Refugio: Expensive at 55 EUR a night for B&amp;B for a solo traveller. I did this, but beware the breakfast is pitiful. One advantage of doing this is that you get a fantastic (and beautifully silent) view of Catania and the bay with all the twinkling golden lights at night.<br />- Tenting: Temperatures are okay in summer. I don't know about the other seasons.<br />- A guided tour: I didn't take one, but this does save you time and note that the cost is quite similar to the Cable car+4WD Jeep+Guide option above.<br /><br />*Take warm clothes and good shoes. In August the walk up is warm but the summit can get chilly. Both of these can be rented from the upper part of the Cable car for a small fee.<br />* Note: to reach the upper crater (inaccessible when i was there due to Volcanic activity) you MUST get a guide. Usually booked from the Refugio Sapeinza base.<br />* There are a couple of craters near the Refugio Sapeinza base. These are nice, but the ones up near the summit are much better.

The starting place for most trips to the south side of Mt Etna is Catania. There is a daily bus from the bus depot which leaves at 08:15 a.m. The AST operated bus depot is at Piazza Pappa Giovanni XXIII. Tickets must first be bought from the AST vendor which is a green shop selling food and drink as well. It is on the corner of the street of Piazza Papa Giovanni XXIII / Via Luigi Sturzo. The bus left from stop number 6.<br /><br />All the guide books list the options of ascent to the summit. We decided based on the steepness of the climb to get the cable car for 28.50 Euro's and walk the rest of the way. The return bus to Catania leaves at 16:30 and therefore there was plenty of time to walk from the cable car to the public summit but the initial climb without using the cable car was very steep and would of ruined any motivation to climb any higher!

He was a native of the area and very informative and talkative. He spoke English, but he had a very thick accent, which at times was difficult for all of us to understand. On the way to Mt. Etna he took us to a small shop where they make their own olive oil and honey. We got to try all kinds of samples, which was great! He then stopped several times on the way to Mt. Etna to show us some interesting points. Mt. Etna was very neat to see if you have not had the opportunity to see a volcano. We then had a wonderful drive to Taormina where the driver gave us some suggestions and dropped us off for some time to explore on our own. This is the only way to do it if you are on a cruise. The only thing that was a negative is that there were four adults in a medium size Mercedes car. This was kind of tight as we took several other tours during our cruise and were in a much more comfortable Mercedes van with Easitaly Tours.

The trip to Mount Etna was arranged by the tour company that brought us to Sicily, and our guide was kind enough to postpone our visit a few days so that we could take the coach up the mountain on a sunny day. Late February and early March can be snowy on the mountain and the day before our visit realized heavy snowfall on the peak and about a foot of snow at 6000 feet. <br /><br />The ride up via coach takes a series of hairpin turns up and up and up past lava flows from previous eruptions, giving an indication of the power of Etna, the most active volcano in all of Europe. At one turn, a house was nearly covered by lava, and at another the remains of a hotel, now abandoned, bore testiment to the devastation visited on the slopes over the years. Like other volcanic sites, the lava and boulder fields are extensive, desolate, and bleak.<br /><br />On the day of our visit, even the lower slopes were snow covered and the traffic on the way up was heavy. Cars were stopped everywhere on both sides of the road and locals appeared to be playing in the deep snow. By the time we neared the 6000 foot mark, traffic was stopped. Vehicles couldn't go up or down. So many people abandoned their cars and walked up, leaving quite a traffic jam that seemed to baffle the local police. After about an hour of talking and gesticulating vigorously, the police took charge and cars began to turn around and head down the mountain. We, in a coach, were lucky to be among the first to turn around. It seemed to take hours and we missed our appointment at the nearby winery. Instead, we stopped at one of the restaurants on the mountainside and dined on pasta and salads. It was a memorable day. I heartily recommend the experience to everybody who visits Sicily.<br /><br />The visit to Mt. Etna turned out to be a highlight of my visit to Sicily, even though we selected Sicily to get away from the snow in Massachusetts. I took dozens of photographs of the mountain from all angles and I never tire of looking at them.

This is a great place to visit. We rode the cable car up and back down, which was quite expensive. For even more euros, you can ride the all terrain trucks up to the top. It was a great view just from the halfway point and we could find all the souvenirs we wanted. It is very windy and cold, so don't forget to put on a jacket! Also, make a stop at one of the curves going up to the volcano where you can see the house that was almost covered in the last eruption.

If Sicily is your trip,don't forget to make Mt.Etna one of your highlight stops,its an experience you shall remember. We drove from Taomina, one of the best touristy ancient town by the sea at the foot of Mt.Etna.The town is nice perched on top of a steep hill with history dated back over 2,000 years old!<br /> The trip up Mt. Etna is not that easy,if you have a car,its about one hour's drive,if by tour,two hours.Once up 1,600 meters to the cable car station,so many souvenier and food shops,you pay 51 euro each for a cable car ride(30 minutes),then 30 minutes by jeep van seating 20 persons up pass snowy ground to 2,600 meter hight ,the guide then lead you as a group around the second tier creater roughly 200 -300 meters in diameter with sulken center and seeing steam coming out from it. The guide explained the last eruption was 2010 with some lava flowing down the slope,but was not dangerous because of slowness of the flow. Mt. Etna is the largest live volcano in Europe.We walked around the crater and could feel the heat emitted from the ground we walked around the rim. Good for picture taking.

We visited Mt. Etna in April 2011 and the weather was warm enough to only need a light jacket. You can drive about 2/3 of the way up the mountain, which gets you above the tree line. The weather was clear all week we were there, and on the day we drove up, we had a great view.<br /><br />Where the road stops, you can continue up the mountain on a cable car which we did not do. There are a number of craters and short hikes around the parking lot, and there were plenty of photo opportunities. <br /><br />We opted to hire a car and driver through Sicily Life, which is a tour company with a lot of positive reviews on tripadivsor. Our driver, Antonio, was fantastic and we had a great day. Picked us up at our hotel, got some coffee in Catania, drove up Etna, visited a honey factory, got lunch, visited a winery, and back at the hotel by 4pm. Highly recommend!

we visited mount Etna in August 2010 and had a lovely experience. we visited the north site. The landscape is like nothing you have ever seen before, just breathtakingly deserted and lunar-like se of volcanic rock.<br />It can be quite tricky to get there via public transport but if you are travelling with a tour operator, it is more than likely that a trip to Etna will be organised. We decided to rent a car and had a lovely journey from Taormina, through lovely sicilian villages.<br />It is very important to remember that Etna is a volcano (therefore altitude which means drop of temperature, erratic weather patterns, etc...), so prepare your clothing adequately with jumper, waterproof clothing, trainers or hiking shoes. we saw a woman at 2700m in short, skimpy vest and flip-flop, obviously totally unprepared for the bitter cold near the summit.<br />If you have the opprtunity anf the money to have a guide to take you to the summit do it as it seems to be a great experince. You get on board these strange jeep buses to go to the summit. We decided to walk to roughly 2900m as we could not access the crater on that day because of safety measure, but where still able to see the plummet of smoke coming from it, then we got too cold ( despite sock, trousers, jumpers and jacket) <br />if you do not want to go in the cable car, you can go around some secondary craters which will give you a great experience as well: they were still active in 2001!<br />Going to the Etna is one of those once in a lifetime opportunity and will stay as one of my best memories ever. If you can, do it you will not regret paying the somewhat hefty price to get into the cable car to go higher on the mountain. There are a few restaurants to eat from at &quot; basecamp&quot;. they are not too overpriced and the food is of reasonable quality, also check the impressive picture of volcanic eruptions on these secondary craters. On the other hand don't buy any volcanic rock: you just need to pick it at your feet! <br />..

We did our excursion starting on a cable car, which dropped us on the top. After that on 4x4 minibus with some other people, we climbed all the way up to the main crater. Umbelievable scenery, looking like a lunar landscape! Then we walked almost to the crater while was erupting lava and the smell of melted shoes was very strong! I don't have any other words to describe the absolutely gorgeus tour we did!

We did an organised tour in a 4x4 up Mount Etna...but also noticed people were simply hiking up either as part of a tour or on their own. The 4x4 tour took three hours and has a very adventurous feel to it as it is a very bumpy ride that it twists and turns up the steep inclines and rocky lava flows.<br /><br />There are several stops along the way to sites of previous eruptions and high up for a great view of the main volcanic cone and clouds below (note, you don't actually reach the top of the main cone).<br /><br />I recommend sun screen and a light jumper as the temperature drops as you climb; it will be slightly cold (I went up in August) when you reach the highest point of the tour.<br />If you are not comfortable with heights then some of the stops might make you nervous as you literally walk around the lip of previous eruptions, so just enjoy the amzing view from where the vehicle parks.<br /><br />We hired a car and drove to Etna Nord via Randazzo and then followed the signs. We ended up at a car park where the tour operators were located. I must admit, finding information on the web for the 4x4 tour operators is challenging.

Unfortunately, our stop was not near long enough to enjoy everything the wonderful island has to offer. Claudio was able to work with us to design a wonderful afternoon. To replace the wine tasting we had hoped for but couldn't do because of time restraints we settled for a glass of wine on the beach at a five star hotel with a magnificent view. From there on to Castelmola and Taormina. Claudio was a jewel. Fantastic personality and completely knowledgable and enthusiastic about his country. I would highly suggest this tour company.

Well worth a visit - and for those who don't fancy the idea of a very long hike up a mountain, the alternative methods of getting close to the top are definitely attractive. I opted to take the cable car (approx.Euros.8), then the 4 wheel drive option to near the rim. The driver of the 4 W.D. was also supposedly the guide, but in my case he just walked us to the first &quot;puff&quot;, rabbited on in Italian and returned to his vehicle. That was pretty disappointing as we had paid generously for the ride and guide (unfortunatlely can't remember exactly how much). Walking around the rim was amazing - Lady Etna was smoking beautifully the day I was there. The wind was howling and the temperature extremely chilly (even though it was mid June 2010). Be sure and go well rugged up and don't forget the camera for the most sensational pics.

We used Sicily Limousine Service for our airport transfers in Sicily last month for our 2nd year. (Catania to Toarmina; Toarmina to Catania.) I work for a tour operator and deal with transport companies on a regular basis so I expect a good service when travelling on my personal holidays also. To repeat the last review left here, Tiffany, the office manager, is very efficient and responds quickly to any inquiries. Claudio was our driver last year and this year was John. John met us with a sign with our name on it at the airport which I find great not to have the hassle of finding taxis and worried about being overcharged! John spoke fluent English &amp; Italian....we would have been lost without him as our apartment was hidden in a back street. He could have just left us at the address but instead waited with us (in the midday sun) until the property owner arrived having spoken to her in Italian as she had no english. We really appreciated that. I highly recommend this company and plan on using their services again. Top marks every time!

After arriving in Messina on a cruise ship, we were met at our ship by a guide from Sicilylife for transport to Mt. Etna. It is rare to find someone like this young man (Corrado) who is as excited about sharing the beauty of his country as we were about seeing it. Our first stop was at the spectacular Alcantara Gorge, where Corrado explained the importance of the gorge as an ancient travel route. Then we passed through several lovely villages, making a brief unscheduled stop at a monastery to see the beautiful view of the surrounding country with Mt. Etna in the backgound. On Mt. Etna, we were able to hike up through a portion of the 2002 lava flow, bordered by forests of pine, birch and broom. We were able to look into an old lava vent, linger over spectular views and, on the way down, hike through a lava cave, the Grotta del Ladroni..fun!. Because we were on a tight schedule, we had an abbreviated version of their Mt. Etna Adventure Tour. We came away feeling that we would like very much to return to Sicily with time on our hands to have a chance to experience more of this beautiful country and its people. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about the history, agriculture, marine life, and the impact of the volcano on the island, now and throughout history. He apparently hiked the area frequently and mentioned that it was a new experience for him every time he went. We loved this trip and highly recommend it!

I have been to Etna several times while living here - the mountain is more volcanic remains than a mountainous area. There are wooded areas with places to hike or just get some shade, but it's primarily volcanish rock and ash. In the winter months, it is difficult to reach a certain altitude of the mountain without an all-wheel drive car but only on really snowy days.<br />I have taken several great pictures from the mountain overlooking other towns and cities as well as views to the ocean on clear days. It's awesome!

Trekking up Mt. Etna is an absolute must! Its stark beauty, against the burgeoning vegetation on its flanks, is a sight like no other. Indeed, the incongruity between the destruction wreaked by the volcano and the vegetation is striking. A full day trip (at least) is advisable. We booked a full day excursion through Volcano Trek. Roberto Caudullo, a vulcanologist, was our guide. He provided us with a wealth of information, which greatly enhanced our experience, about the volcano and its environs. He also took us to hard to reach areas, which we never would have been able to access without him. He was very nice and very receptive to questions. I highly recommend booking an excursion up Etna with Volcano Trek and Roberto in particular! <br /><br />If you go, bring your camera. Again, it's absolutely beautiful up there. Also wear good shoes. You'll probably be doing a lot of walking on uneven terrain. Also make sure that you have warm clothes. It's quite cold and windy towards the summit.

We rented a car at the airport in Catania and drove to Taoramina, which is where we stayed for a few days and it was wonderful there and highly recommended as a destination in itself. We then drove to the highest point on Etna. The trip up was also wonderful as the view got better and better the higher up you went, traveling through many little towns along the way. We started out earing summer wear but soon found that there was now on the ground at the observation level of the mountain, so pack at least a heavy sweater. At this level we walked through the gift shop and the little tourist stands before taking the cable car up toward the top of the mountain. Unfortunately we didn't get up to the level to see lava as the height made for shortness of breath, but we did get to play in the heavy snow as high up as we could go. The cable car down could be a little scary if you are squeamish since it tends to rock back and forth at the descent is steep. But overall it was fun and easily just a few hours from Taoramina.

My brother and I booked a Mt Etna tour with SAT on 10 Apr. The price was 32 euro for the bus from Taormina. If you want to add the cable car and jeep to the higher level it's 75 euro. Booking at Etna would cost you the 32 plus 51 for the cable car and jeep. So booking the cable car and jeep with SAT saves you 8 euro. The bus ride takes a little over an hour. The bus stopped at a restaraunt at Silvestri Craters for a bathroom break and then proceeded to the cable car area. The cable car takes about 15 min. At the top is a restaraunt and toilet. You then proceed on jeep driving between mounds of snow and rock. The jeep ride is about 20 min. Unfortunately, the visibility wasn't great but still interesting to walk around the craters and see the steam and feel the warm ground even while it was snowing. The guide takes you on a short trek. Overall, a great experience but I wish they had sunrise tours since the visibility seems to deteriorate during the day.

My friend living in Italy recommended that I must visit Sicily, especially Castelmola in my next trip to Italy. Sicily? The lawless island where rules play second fiddle to unwritten codes and respect is won through cunning and strong arm? Never mind the Mafia and their hair-raising stories. It’s the ubiquitous overloaded Vespas hurtling through the skinny cobbled alleyways, picking your pockets, snatching your bags and stabbing you accidentally that intimidates me. But I am not one that easily gives in to fear. Travelling alone as a lady and often love to venture off the beaten track, I decided to book a customized tour on my first trip to Sicily. <br />After much research, I picked Sicily Life.com mainly because it was the least expensive among other customized tour agencies in Sicily, the most responsive and flexible. I also read glowing reviews about it in several independent travel websites. (Note:- Of course the price of a customized tour will look exorbitant when compared with a DIY-own driving/ public transport tour but they are not comparable. In buying a customized tour, you are also buying a peace of mind, flexibility and the luxury of just sit back and relax. Having said that, based on my experience, I must say that the average price of a customized tour in Sicily is still a lot higher compared to those around other Mediterranean countries like Greece, Spain, Turkey and even Amalfi Coast!) <br />I did the Etna, Godfather and around Palermo tours with Sebastiano and Antonio of Sicily Life. Both of them spoke good English and were very knowledgeable and entertaining. I also found both of them very accommodating. Where possible, they will go all the way out to meet your needs, like finding a place for lunch that satisfied my craving for wild-mushroom. <br />I was also very impressed with their driving. Sebastiano was a very skilled and cautious driver, confidently and calmly negotiated the sharp, tight and steep bends around Castlemola (even in a foggy, almost-zero visibility night!), Savoca and Forza D’Agro. Antonio, on the other hand, was very skilled in traversing the insane traffic of Palermo where a red light at a junction often means driving on if you do not see an oncoming car! <br />Unlike some tour agents who are very calculative with the extra things they do for you vis-à-vis the tips they expect from you, what I love most about Sicily Life is that Sebastiano is a very warm, easy-going and generous person, someone who can be your friend. He is also very thoughtful, trying to anticipate your needs and interest. Throughout the trips he never mentioned about payment. (You can pay him at the end of your trip). The only thing he asked was to pay him in cash…. but that was only for tax reasons, which I fully understood :-)

We also used Sicily Life for our transfer from the train to the hotel and from the hotel to the Catania airport. Our drivers/tour guides were the two different Antonios, Sebastiano and Domenico. All of these men were prompt, well informed and patient as we traveled with four of our children. At no time did we feel rushed. They were very accommodating, allowing us to see whatever we were interested in. They even helped us find a shipping store to send gifts back to the States when we were having a problem doing so on our own. These men are passionate about their region and showed great pride in sharing it with us. We enjoyed a cooking class with Angela in her home. We learned to make some Sicilian specialties and then enjoyed them for a wonderful lunch. In addition, Sebastiano recommended we stay at Hotel Villa Shuler in Taormina for our 5 nights. That was an excellent recommendation. Every moment of our enjoyable stay we owe thanks to Sebastiano and his company. We are hoping to return to Sicily soon and enjoy some of the other tours that Sicily Life offers. I'm sure my children will have fond memories of this trip.

On all legs of the journey the guide talked us through histories of the area's, volcano etc. He covered this in English, German and Italian (and I suspect French as there were a number of them aboard). The talks were for the most part interesting and informative and really helped the long journey up the volcano flow that little faster. If I was to criticise this aspect, there was a slight element of 'upselling' going on, but I think this is endemic to this outing (there were 3 different vans giving out free honey trying to get you to buy it). The coach dropped us at the south refuge for over 3 hours.<br /><br />From the south refuge you can catch a cable car taking you another 500m up the mountain and from there take a &quot;jeep&quot; (a small 4WD coach) up to one of the main craters. All of this would set you back another €51 and it takes about 2.5 hours for the return trip.<br /><br />On the other hand you can stay at the south refuge and explore the now dormant Silvestri craters. We thought long and hard about which option as we were on a limited budget, but thought the Silvestri craters would only take about half an hour to wander round, leaving us bored for the remaining time.<br /><br />Our wallets eventually won out, and I in no way regret it. Once we started exploring the 2 easily accessible craters, the options opened out. There are a number of trails to further craters both up and down the volcano, so you really can spend a good amount of time in this area. In the end, a stop for lunch took up all the rest of the time and we had to rush back to meet the coach on time.<br /><br />Views from this level of the volcano are superb and we really felt as though we'd got our moneys worth from the trip. I've not been up to the next level, but do wonder if it would be worth tripling the overal cost of the excursion?<br /><br />As mentioned this trip returns to Taormina via the alacantra gorge, please see my review there for further details.

We have recently returned from a cruise around Italy and one of our ports of call was Naxos in Sicily. We booked a tour with Sicily Life and our driver, Antonio, was waiting for us at the dock when we arrived. We spent a wonderful day with him, first driving up Mt Etna, enjoying the lovely scenery and views along the way and arriving at the crater before the coaches arrived. He then took us to a village where we sampled local honey, olive oil and wine and were able to buy a few products to take home. After that we went to visit a winery where the views were stunning and we tasted more local wine. We ended our visit at Taormina which is a charming town, where we had lunch and visited the Amphitheatre. Again, there were spectacular views from here and we were able to see our cruise ship against a distant threatening sky - luckily that was as near to rain as we came during our holiday. Antonio of Sicily Life was an excellent driver and guide who helped us make the most of our short visit to Sicily and gave us the opportunity to sample the highlights of this beautiful island in a very memorable and enjoyable tour.

We loved Taormina. Christian of Sicily Limousines met us promptly in Messina. His English was easy for us to understand (much better than our Italian). He explained a lot about the area. We stopped at the village below Taormina to take some pics and then drove up to Castelmora 500m above the sea. The view was outstanding. Christian dropped us for a while so we could explore Taormina on our own. We went to the Greek Theater, walked along the pedestrian only street, had pizza and then walked to the National Garden. I'm so glad we booked this private excursion. What a beautiful place!

We used Sicily Limousine Service for all of our transfers in Sicily recently. (Catania to Toarmina; Toarmina to Milazzo; Messina to Catania.) Tiffany, the office manager, responded promptly to all inquiries and her quotes were reasonable - there were no surprises. Claudio was our driver on two occaisions; he met us with a sign with our name on it at the airport as was promised by the company. Claudio spoke fluent English and was very helpful by answering all of our questions during the transfers. It was wonderful not have to worry about how to get from place to place! On our trip from Messina to Catania another driver (equally as professional and knowledgeable - I forget his name!) met us at the ferry with a sign and took us promptly to our hotel in Catania (about an hour and 45 minutes away). We highly recommend this company and plan on using their services again; the cars were impeccable, the employees professional and courteous (they even seemed surprised when we offered a tip at the end of our transfers). Highly recommended for a no worries transfer.

We could not imagine celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary anywhere else in the world but Taormina, Sicily. And who would help us arrange the renewal of our vows in a 1500 year old church... (with a priest who had the vows ready in English)... non other than Sebastiano from Sicily Life! Afterward, Sebastiano took us for a drive on the coastline, to be followed by a walk through the town of Taormina. The day ended with a wonderful lunch up in Castelmola with a special anniversary cake baked by this Father! We have known Sebastiano since our first trip (four trips ago) to Sicily in 2001, and he has been arranging our ground, hotel, excursions and restaurant reservations each time. Whether you are flying directly into Sicily, or stopping in Taormina for the day by ship, contact Sicily Life. They bring excellent value and provide customized and specialized tours that will meet your specific needs and desires. Sebasiano, Allessandro and staff are reliable, well organized and trustworthy. They are not only our ground/excursion company of choice, they are our true lifetime friends!

We took the Mt Etna tour with Sicily Life in June.<br />The guide was great, spoke fluent English and told us a lot of information about the mountain and the surroundings, took us to the honey and wine tasting as everyone has mentioned here.<br />I don't know if I expected too much from reading other great reviews--- but I felt it's a bit over priced.<br />This trip takes you half way to the top of the mountain.<br />If you want to go higer you need to catch the cable car which is 27 Euros per person then you need to hire another guide to go to the top which is 50 something Euros.

It seems some tourists are not aware they are 9000 ft up a volcano. This is not the place for shorts and sandals; wear long pants, jackets, scarfs, earmuffs....anything to keep warm! <br /><br />The funicular and the jeep ride are not the most scenic but the experience at the top is unforgettable. Ridiculously cold and windy with the clouds reducing visibility to a few dozen feet, the guide warned us not to stray from the group. Between the cold, the wind, the altitude, and the short walk on unstable ground, it can be hard to catch your breath. I hear the view from the top is great when you can actually see it.<br /><br />The mandatory guided walk at the top includes the history of the volcano and information about vocanoes in general. Despite the fact that no one at the refuge (at the restaurants, shops, or the ticket point), at the top of the funicular, or on the jeep spoke English, it seems all tours are conducted in English. The guide did summaries in Italian for those who did not speak English.

He spoke good English and was really well informed. He picked us up from the hotel at 9am and off we set for Mt Etna. We stopped for wine tasting on the way up at the Murco Vineyards, it worth getting some bottles there! we then headed for the Silvestri craters. on the way we got some good shots of mt etna as it was smoking! it got quite cloudy so view was poor the higher we went but it was still really good. we stopped at a honey making place on the way back selling some great 'foodie' stuff. Antonio kindly made an extra stop off at castlemola as we had wanted to visit it so we ran over time but it was no problem to him. <br />I really recomend this company.

We were on a Globus tour and had a free day in Taormina. We wanted to visit the hometown of 3 of my husband’s 4 grandparents with a stop at Mt. Etna on the return to our hotel. After a lot of research and posting a request for suggestions for private tour companies on tripadvisor’s Sicily forum, we received 3 recommendations. Sicily Life ([-]) was the least expensive. Our English speaking driver, Domenico, was both delightful and informative. His driving skills on the steep, local lava-stone roads were amazing. Not sure exactly what we wanted to do when we got to the town, he offered several suggestions. It turned out to be a truly memorable event, particularly for my husband. Afterward we headed for Etna and Domenico guided us on a leisurely stroll along the ridge (pictured) and to an awesome crater. We stopped for lunch and were happy to call it a day. However, determined to give us a full 8 hours, he brought us to local vineyard. Domenico then drove us along the shore of Giardini Naxos before returning us to our hotel. Be assured that the company does have the NCC license and your trip will be worth every penny!!

Sicily (Messina) was another port of call on our Carnival Cruise. To be honest we weren't really looking forward to this stop. Mt Etna really didn't appeal to me, but I had to do something with the family. <br /><br />Booking with Sicily Life ended up being the smartest thing we did. Our after cruise assesment is that the Mt Etna/Taormina trip with Sicily Life was one of our top 3 activities. <br /><br />The trip to Mt Etna is long, but once you are there it really is amazing. Along the way you get to see the remnants of past lava flows and how nature is reclaiming them. The craters at the top are surreal. We had the craters to ourselves for almost an hour before the cruise sponsored tours showed up. On the way down we stopped at a winery and a honey factory for samples. I have never tasted honey in so many variations. We had a couple of hours in Taormina to eat, shop and sight see before heading back to the ship.

I have no choice but to write a review on Trip Advisor. Trip Advisor is my number one choice when researching upcoming vacations. As a result of past reviews on Trip Advisor and an incredible day with Sicily Life (Sebastiano in paraticular), we now have a number one choice for tour companies in Sicily.<br /><br />From the moment Sebastiano met us at the port, we knew it was going to be a lovely day. Truly feeling as though we were travelling with a friend versus sitting in a very long history or geography class, Sebastiano shared something new and exciting at every corner.<br /><br />I was very specific in what I wanted to see prior to visiting Sicily. With a Sicilian background, I wanted to see more than the typical tourist would see. Without a doubt, Sebastiano came through and we felt very blessed to be able to be treated to such a day.<br /><br />Not only were we able to see all of the local attractions that were not too far from the Messina port, but we were also treated to an incredible wine tasting at a local winery. From the wine, to the vineyards to the views, what an amazing visit that was. I was only saddened my luggage would only let me bring home four bottles. It was fabulous! (And I can say that, living in California with many spectacular wines!)<br /><br />We visited Taormina where Sebastiano recommended a local Sicilian restaurant that was - incredible! I honestly believe that if I were to return for a two week visit, I could eat every meal at that restaurant. I can' t wait to return!<br /><br />Sebastiano is the only recommendation I have for Sicily. He will customize your trip to your specific interests and needs. Most imporantly, he is an incredible wonderful man who is so very proud of his ancestory and willing to share it with his 'friends'. We miss him terribly...<br /><br />Book with Sicily Life!!!

We were on Carnival's Freedom ship this July and were in Messina on July 4th. About 1 month or so before the trip, I booked with Michele Gallo and Sicilytravel.net.<br />I had asked for a tour a bit different than the average one that usually takes you to where the cable cars are and then you're on your own.<br />Michele hired our guide Flavia, who lived in a village right on Mt. Etna. She took us hiking up to the crater where we were able to watch the lava flow right into it!!!!! It was an awesome experience.<br />I was a bit leary about volunteering to organize this trip for our group because you never know how everyone will like the tour and how it will turn out. But EVERYONE loved it and kept thanking me all cruise long. I just want to say to Michele at Sicilytravel....<br />Thank you so much for putting together this tour for us! Everyone had a spectacular time! Flavia was fantastic and the village we stopped in for lunch was the talk of the group! We absolutely loved every minute of it and can't thank you enough!

South Wales,52.1306607,-3.7837117,"
August 2008. Arrived at Refugio Sapienza just after 9. Make sure you allow plenty of time to get there - the mountain road can take longer than you think (it took us an hour and twenty from Taormina). The long trek was leaving at 10.30 which we didn't expect but it gave us plenty of time to look around at the gift shops - which were just opening - and the fantastic views (you're about 3,000 feet up at this point already) and have a drink. The Etna guides hut is easy to spot and is on the left near the road as you face the cable car station. The long trek is €60 each and includes the hire of walking boots and a jacket if you don`t have them. You will also need to bring something to tie around your face such as a scarf or t-shirt as the sulphur fumes at the summit can be quite overpowering and acidic. We met up back at the hut at around 10.15 got kitted up and were herded to the cable car station for the first part of the trip. At the top it was over to the big 4x4 jeeps for the next stage. At the end of the jeep journey there is a large high crater to one side which the short trekkers visit, but we headed off towards the summit, first splitting into three groups depending on your language (Italian, French or English). Now here's a warning you should heed: this is not a walk in the park, it's a hard slog. I am not unfit, but I had trouble keeping up with the guide and I wasn't the only one. In fact one of our group dropped out after twenty minutes and went back to the jeep station. There are notices warning asthma sufferers and those with heart conditions not to try it, but that doesn`t really tell you what you`re in for. You also need to be aware that you will be walking up steep slopes and over very loose, uneven ground and you really don't want to fall over onto the sharp volcanic stones. If you're still determined to make the trip then your efforts will be rewarded by the views over Sicily and more importantly the chance to peer into Etna's fume-filled main crater. It's really quite eerie standing at the top and looking down into the swirling sulphur. The crater is very wide and deep making it all the more impressive. You'll also see - and smell - plenty of gas issuing from other points above, below and around you and you'll certainly appreciate that scarf around your face. After about half an hour we headed back roughly the way we came which included an exhilarating run down the side which was a bit like going down a sand dune but one that was made out of volcanic ash. Back at the top jeep station we had our lunch (down at the guide's hut I noticed they were selling packed lunches - €5, I think - but we'd brought our own) It was high summer and not that cold, even high up. With all the walking I ended up carrying my jacket more than wearing it, but by the time we got back for lunch the cloud had rolled in and that made all the difference; it was very chilly then and you needed something warm to wear. About half of our group - even the younger ones - had had enough by now and decided to take the jeep and cable car back down; this cost another €17 each, so be warned. The rest of us set off on a different route which brought us fantastic views of the huge Valle del Bove. It was about here that the day took an odd turn (no pun intended) when the guide veered off down another steep ash slope which a couple of people in our group found a bit daunting and so went down it quite slowly. He (the guide) clearly didn't like this and complained about slow people who shouldn't be on this trek. I ( who wasn't one of the slow ones I should add) told him that he was going too fast and anyway running off the path down a 45 degree slope was not my definition of a `trek` (it was fun though, but I didn't tell him that!). He continued to grumble all the way back to the car park and by then he had no doubts about what I thought of him. The annoying thing was that we were told before we set off that we would be back between 4 and 4.30 - we got back at 4.15, so what was his problem? Judging by the fact that he changed into his motorcycling gear pretty quick when we got back, a prior engagement was possibly the answer. All in all it was a great experience and one I'd recommend. Can't say I liked the guide though; if there really was a problem then I'm sure it can't be the first time and someone needs to make it quite clear to potential trekkers what they can expect to face before taking their money.

Kudos to Sicily Life for providing my group of 12 (ages 15-54) with a very special day touring Mt. Etna, the Sicilian countryside, and Taormina. On a 12-day Carnival Freedom cruise as well a pre-cruise independent stay in Rome, we had arranged for private excursions/transport/tour guides in Rome, Amalfi/Pompeii, Sicily, Barcelona, and Pisa/Florence. It was a tour-intensive trip with many gems along the away. However, besides our Roman Colosseum/Forum tour with Francesca Caruso, the day spent with Sebastiano of Sicily Life was a definite highlight of the trip for many in our group, particularly for the three 18-year old boys (who are sometimes hard to please).<br /><br />Sebastiano and driver were waiting for us at the Messina port at 7:30 am. In a 16-passenger luxury minibus, we passed through the Sicilian countryside driving up curvy, narrow roads to reach Mt. Etna while Sebastiano recounted tales of prior eruptions and interesting stories related to the culture and economy of Sicily. We walked on a Silvestri Crater and later had a nice break at a place to taste various types of local honey (nice gifts). Because Sebastiano lives in Taormina, as he walked us through his charming village pointing out the special sights, we were able to get a free taste of delicacies in one shop whose owner he knew. A must - try the canoli! Note: Sebastiano can reserve and pre-order lunch to save time or he can recommend restaurants for eating. We were given some free time for lunch and browsing and later met Sebastiano, so that he could escort us back to the bus for the ride back to Messina. Remember to bring snacks, water, and dramamine if subject to car sickness and layered clothing as it can be cool on Mt. Etna but very warm in Taormina. Wear good walking shoes for walking on the crater. <br /><br />Often, one takes a tour and is fatigued from being bombarded with an endless stream of dates and facts. It was a special treat to get a glimpse of Sicilian daily life through Sebastiano's eyes. This charming Sicilian is proud of his homeland and wants to share it with visitors. The day passed quickly by because of Sebastiano's entertaining commentary. I heartily recommend Sicily Life.<br /><br />Our tour from 7:30 until 3:30 was very reasonable in price (paid in cash at the end of the tour). When booking, I faxed Sebastiano a credit card # for guarantee only; he did not charge the card. Sebastiano responded very quickly to all of my emails. Note: 95% of our tours/excursions were paid at the end of the tour in euro cash. We travelled with 2 credit cards and 2 debit cards (4 digit password) and also called all of our banks/credit card companies pre-trip to increase daily withdrawl limits and notify them of when and where we were traveling so that they wouldn't put a hold on our accounts. Also checked with health insurance company to ensure international coverage for emergencies.

We visited Taormina off season in Nov when organised tours are very limited. However we found a company online -Sicily Life -who arranged a private tour for us. Although it cost a little more (approx £120 for a day) it was worth it. The guide taylored the tour to what we wanted to see, also included local craft shops and of course spent lots of time at Mt Etna. He was very informative about Sciand allowed lots of photo stops. We even had a delicious traditional lunch in a mountain village. Well worth the extra money.

We had read all of the reviews on this forum regarding SicilyLife and were suspicious that they might be artificially created by some clever marketing guy working for them. But we went forward with booking the tour to the top of Mt Etna anyway. Fantastic experience!<br /><br />We had Alessandro and his English is very good. He gave us far more insight into Sicilian life (and how it's been affected by the volcano) than you'd ever get from a book. The tour included a stop in Zafferana on the way up, and a stop at a local winery (Murgo winery) and the town of Naxos (coastal town) on the way down. It was about 5 hours total and cost 180 Euro for our private group of 5 people. Well worth it!<br /><br />Alessandro was a good driver and you didn't need to have a death grip on the door handle as we winded up and down the mountain. <br /><br />We had Sebastiano take us to the airport and he was a little more 'Italian' in his driving style but nothing excessive. Sebastiano's accent is a little thicker but he has a good command of the language so once you get the hang of him, it's easy to understand.<br />

We took the gondola which goes almost to the top, amazing views toward the coast. Hint... before you pay extra (20 something Euros each) for the jeep ride to the very top, ask the people getting off if they could see anything. The day we went, the top was in the clouds and the volcano was inactive. Instead we hiked one of the cones. The restaurant where the gondola lands was very good.<br />

Me and my boyfriend went to Sicily at the end of August and stayed there for a week. That was a really unforgettable experience for us. I want to thank Sicily Life for organising our transportation from Catania airport to Taormina and our tour to Mount Etna. And especially I want to thank Luca. He was a great guide, we learned a lot of interesting facts about Mount Etna, Taormina, Gardini Naxos and Castelmola from him. I recommend Taormina and the neighbouring towns to all the people who would like to visit Sicily and have the time of their lives. <br /><br />Grazie, Luca. Grazie, Sicily Life.<br /><br />
