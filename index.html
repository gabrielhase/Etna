          <p>In 1923 the newspaper The Economist writes a parallel of an eruption of Mount Etna with the tense political situation in Europe due to the reparation payments of Germany and the glooming economic downfall (see excerpt below). Only five years later, in 1928, Mount Etna has another major eruption completely destroying the town of Mascali. In the following rebuilding works, Mussolini and his National Facist Party could foster their position in Sicily and spread national socialism.</p>

            This story shows that the volcano Mount Etna is more than just ash and lava. Volcanoes play a vital role in the life and development of cultures that settle around them. The intention of this article is to show how Mount Etna affects the people living in the small idyllic towns at the slopes of the volcano and how our generation perceives Mount Etna. Under the headline «Curse or Attraction» the balancing act is shown of a Mount Etna that is a threat to life and property and a worthwhile tourist attraction at the same time.

          <p>Almost a century later there are thousands of people hoping for the next lava streams coming out of Mt. Etna: Volcano Tourists.</p>
          <p>
            Mount Etna stands at 3323 meters height surrounded by the Parco dell'Etna, a national park. Every year thousands of tourists walk up the slopes of Mount Etna, ski down the lava ash, or stroll through subterrean lava tubes. Chester writes in his book "Mount Etna: The anaotmy of a volcano": «The Etna region has been at the forefront of the tourism boom for the last twenty-five years, because it is one of the few active volcanoes within easy reach of the northern European package tourist and is conveniently located near the town of Taormina, one of the principal package-tour centres in Sicily. ... From what has been written it is easy to conclude that, notwithstanding the ever-present hazard from volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, over the long term the region gains more from the volcano than it loses through short-term though often catastrophic events.».

          <p>Etna is not only an attraction to volcanologist, but also for hikers who want to enjoy the landscape around Etna. The website from the Parco dell'Etna features the following points of Interest:</p>
          <ul class="no-list">
            <li>
              <h3>The Montagnola</h3>
              <p>Among the volcanic cones of Etna, the Montagnola is one of the most impressive. It is situated in the south of the Central Crater, on the upper southern slope where it rose at 2,500 meters of height after the eruption in summer 1763.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Silvestri Mountains</h3>
              <p>Silvestri Mountains formed after the eruption of 1982 along a radial fracture (called "bottoniera") from which 5 eruptive cones emerged. Between Mt. Silvestri Superiore and the one immediately below, called Mt. Silvestri Inferiore, there is the road leading from Zafferana and Nicolosi to Sapienza Mountain Hut, an obliged destination for the visitors of the southern slope of Etna.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Highest Craters</h3>
              <p>The summit of the volcano is currently made of the Central Crater (Voragine and Bocca Nuova), the northern-eastern Crater (1911), and the southern-eastern Crater (1971). The height of the volcano is of about 3,340 meters above sea-level, but this varies because of the accumulation of the material deriving from the explosions on the one side, and on the other because of the frequent collapse of the walls.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>The Caves</h3>
              <p>Within the Park there are over 200 caves formed by the lava stream. Known since the past, they have been used by man as sacred or burial places, shelters or storage places for snow when this was the only form of refreshment during the summer. Among the most famous there are: the caves of Lamponi, Tre Livelli, Gelo, and Palombe.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Bove Valley</h3>
              <p>Bove Valley is one of the most important naturalistic areas of the Park. It is an enormous basin situated on the eastern slope of the volcano, which, according to some theories, is the result of the collapse of the original crater complex. The basin is 7 km long and 5 km wide, with walls which reach the 1,000 meters of height. In the night between the 13th and 14th of December 1991, at about 2,400 meters of height, there was an eruption which gave birth to a lava flow which lasted until the spring of 1993.</p>

          <h3>Plume</h3>
          <p>
            The plume of a volcano is its eruption column. It consists of hot volcanic ash emitted during an explosive volcanic eruption. The ash forms a column rising many kilometres into the air above the peak of the volcano. In the most explosive eruptions, the eruption column may rise over 40 km, penetrating the stratosphere. Stratospheric injection of aerosols by volcanoes is a major cause of short-term climate change.
          </p>
          <h3>Explosions</h3>
          <p>
            An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such an eruption is driven by gas accumulating under great pressure. Driven by hot rising magma, it interacts with ground water until the pressure increases to the point at which it bursts violently through the over mantle of rock. In many cases, the rising magma will contain large quantities of partially dissolved gas. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. With the sudden release of pressure following the initial explosion, the gas comes out of solution violently and explosively. This secondary explosion is often far more violent than the first one; the rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material may be blown 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred metres per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter.
          </p>
          <h3>Ash</h3>
          <p>
            Volcanic ash consists of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions, less than 2 mm (0.079 in) in diameter. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.
          </p>
          <h3>Airport Shutdowns</h3>
          <p>
            If an eruption has a lot of ash emissions airports nearby have to be shutdown because of the risk to fly through the ash filled airspace. In April 2010, when Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano erupted, air traffic all but ceased over Europe as controllers worried about the effects of volcanic ash on the engines of a plane.<br/>
            Volcanic ash affects aircrafts in a variety of ways. Firstly, the ash has a sandblasting effect on any aircraft, with the billions of particles colliding with its fuselage and damaging its landing lights and main body. Secondly, ash can clog many of the aircraft’s sensors, such as the pitot tubes (pressure measurement) and, because the ash’s particles are charged, communication radios. Thirdly, and potentially with the worst consequences, ash can cause combustion power failure, leaving the plane with no engine thrust and minimal chance of landing without a catastrophic crash.
          </p>
          <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
          <p>
            A volcano tectonic earthquake is an earthquake induced by the movement (injection or withdrawal) of magma. The movement results in pressure changes in the rock around where the magma has experienced stress. At some point, the rock may break or move. The earthquakes may also be related to dike intrusion and may occur as earthquake swarms. Other types of seismic activity related to volcanoes and their eruptions are long period seismic waves, which are from sudden sporadic movement of magma, which is blocked from moving due to a blockage. Another is a harmonic tremor, which is steady movement of magma, deep in the mantle.
          </p>

          <h3>Destruction</h3>
          <p>
            In rare and tragic cases whole towns or areas are destroyed due to volcanic eruptions. Probably the most known destruction is the Minoan eruption on the island of Santorini. It is believed by some historians that the island was much larger and in fact known as Atlantis. Most of Atlantis was destroyed by the explosive eruption and only what we know today as the greek island of Santorini remained. The explosion also triggered a Tsunami which reached the island of Crete and destroyed the Minoan culture there.<br/>
            The last destruction by Mount Etna was the town of Mascali in 1928.

          <p>Mario Fichera, a resident of the small town Zafferana Etnea at the slope of Mt. Etna, refers to the volcano as being like a lighthous for a sailor. It's a point of reference for the people living in Zafferana (see the video below). The town Zafferana was threatened by lava streams between 1991 and 1993. Artificial dams were built to keep the lava streams away from the town. Yet in May 1992 the lava came up to a distance of 800 meters of the town. By that time the people of Zafferana did not build dams anymore but prayed to the mother Mary to which they still attribute the rescue of their city.</p>

          <p>
            Mount Etnas eruptions are mostly lava eruptions. This is in contrast to other volcanoes like for example Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia. Lava eruptions send slow streams of lava down the slopes of the mountain. The lava burries everything in its way, but since it is rather slow it's less dangerous to people since they can be evacuated in time. Explosive eruptions like the one from Mount Merapi in 2010 are much more dangerous since they send hot ash clouds (several hundred degrees celcius) down the mountain that travel with very high speeds of up to 100km per hour and kill everybody in its way.

            <h3>Explosivity Index (VEI)</h3>
            <p>
              The volcanic Explosivity Index, short VEI, was devised to provide a relative measure of the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions. Volume of products, eruption cloud height, and qualitative observations (using terms ranging from "gentle" to "mega-colossal") are used to determine the explosivity value. The scale is open-ended with the largest volcanoes in history given magnitude 8. A value of 0 is given for non-explosive eruptions. The scale is logarithmic, with each interval on the scale representing a tenfold increase in observed ejecta criteria, with the exception between 0 and 2.
            </p>
            <p>
              The VEI can not directly be used to measure the impact of an eruption on people. While most destruction around Etna was caused by lava, this is not measured in the VEI at all.
              The VEI is still the most used index to measure volcanic eruptions and the only index that is widely available.

            Mount Etna is both a thread and an attraction. We've seen that the people in the towns of Mount Etna have registered the volcano as part of their daily lives. Yet effects are dangerous and cause damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following map explores the interaction between effects of the volcano and trends in population. The eruptions chart at the bottom of the map can be used to select a timeframe. When selecting e.g. the time from 1920 to 1930 the town Mascali at the sea changes color to red which means that its population was shrinking in that time. The reason for it is just next to it: the black cross indicates that this town was destroyed by an eruption in 1928 (and rebuild later). Selecting the time from 1985 to 1995 we see that the people of Zafferana Etnea really like their town. Despite the imminent danger they were facing the population kept rising. After all, who wouldn't want to live in a beautiful Sicilian town at a mountain slope overlooking the mediterrean sea. Close by Giarre on the other hand had people leave the town during this time. Maybe the prospect of having the same fate as Zafferana was  more scary than actually being in Zafferana. The main city of the region, Catania, is constantly shrinking since 1960. The effect might be explained that the city mainly relies on tourism, not least of all tours to Mt. Etna, and young people look for education and jobs in other places. The other big cities, Messina and Siracusa, follow a similar trend.

            Ultimately, whether a volcano attracts or dispels people is a complex question. Both are true and for a wide range of reasons. Use the map as a tool to explore your own story of the volcano Mount Etna and its people.

        <h3>Project Title: «Mount Etna: Curse or Attraction?»</h3>
        <h3>The map visualization</h3>
        <p>The map visualization combines a lot of different data in one place. It actually consists of three parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The map itself that can be navigated freely.</li>
          <li>The bar chart of all eruptions at the bottom of the map that can be toggled and can be used to make timeframe selections.</li>
          <li>The towns explorer on the right hand side that can be used to get detailed information about the towns around Etna.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The data encoded in the visualization is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Population Trends of towns: Each town is either green or red for growing or shrinking population respectively (overall or in the selected timeframe).</li>
          <li>Total Population of towns: Each town icon on the map comes in one of three sizes (large: above 100000, medium: above 25000, small: under 25000). The size updates with the selected timeframe (end of the timeframe).</li>
          <li>Volcanic Events: Upon selecting a timeframe the events from the volcano are shown by little pins on the map with popovers. The events include:
            <ul>
              <li>Ash falling on a town</li>
              <li>Explosions at craters</li>
              <li>Destruction of towns</li>
              <li>Airport Shutdowns</li>
              <li>Earthquakes triggered by an eruption</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            VEI of an eruption: This is indicated by a circle of respective size to the power of the explosion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lava Flows of an eruption: The lava flows are drawn in red on the map with popovers indicating the year they occured.
          </li>
          <li>Town Details: For each town there are details in the towns explorer (line chart showing the population trend in the 20th century, an image and descriptive text).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>All three components interact with each other. The user can interact with the visualization by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Selecting a timeframe to see according events and population trends in the map.</li>
          <li>Navigating the map to see more detail, e.g. zooming in to see where exactely a lava flow went through.</li>
          <li>Clicking on towns icons on the map or selecting towns in the towns explorer to get detailed information about a town.</li>
        </ul>
